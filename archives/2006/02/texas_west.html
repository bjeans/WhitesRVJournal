<h3>Texas West</h3>

<p>The road to Laredo runs northwest&nbsp;beside the Rio Grande&nbsp;but again we could not see it most of the time&nbsp;because of the berm.&nbsp; The land is flat and along the valley there is irrigation that allows for farming and cultivation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather since we got to the valley has been very warm during the day &ndash; from 75 to 85 F &ndash; but it does cool down nicely during the night.&nbsp; One night there was a little rain, but in general it is dry with the sun every day.&nbsp; Great for us but not so great for the farmers in the valley.</p>
<p>We were going only 140 miles and planned to stop in&nbsp;Laredo for one night as we were on our way to &ndash; we weren't really sure &ndash; either Carlsbad Caverns in southeastern New Mexico or Big Bend National Park in southwest Texas.</p>
<p>Laredo is a major border town and that is about the best thing that can be said about it.&nbsp; Actually, the best thing was the county park that we stayed in right beside a man-made lake.&nbsp; We drove downtown that afternoon to the historic district and walked around, but even the historic district has little to impress.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an old town and is struggling.&nbsp; 'Nuf said.</p>
<p>So,&nbsp;Thursday morning, Feb. 2, we packed up to leave.&nbsp; Problem.&nbsp; When I went to close the slide on the passenger side of the trailer, it wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The rear end moved the front didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; After&nbsp;numerous calls&nbsp;to our dealer in London and also the Hitchhiker factory in Kansas, it was determined that a pin had sheared.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have a hydraulic jack with us and with much fiddling and about an inch or two at a time, we were able to get it closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laredo had no RV dealer and no <img height="208" alt="DSC_0215_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0215_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />RV repair service to help us.&nbsp; Our dealer in London made arrangements for us to go to a dealer in El Paso on the following Tuesday.&nbsp; We could have gone earlier but decided to go to Carlsbad on the way.&nbsp; This all took us about 4 hours so we stayed another night in Laredo.</p>
<p>Did I say the land was flat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The land is flat.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still sunny and warm&nbsp;as we headed northwest stopping one night in Del Rio &ndash;&nbsp;a lovely border town surrounded by&nbsp;cultivated land as&nbsp;there are&nbsp;springs in the area for irrigation.&nbsp; We&nbsp;toured the Val Verde Winery, the oldest winery in&nbsp;Texas and happened to be in town for the &ldquo;First Friday Art Walk&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The art galleries open their doors in the evening and have wine &amp; refreshments and the local artists&nbsp;are also in attendance.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0241" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0241_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The next day, we&nbsp;visited Lantry, just off the main highway,&nbsp;to see where Judge Roy Bean, the frontier judge, dispensed beer and &ldquo;the law west of the Pecos&rdquo; from a saloon.&nbsp; His original saloon is now maintained by the National Park Service.&nbsp; Apparently he always sentenced&nbsp;the guilty party to a fine and kept the fine for his fees. </p>
<p>There is also a wonderful botanical garden with native desert plants.</p>
<p>We arrived at Carlsbad Caverns in south eastern New Mexico early on Sunday Feb 5th. I&rsquo;m going to send a separate journal with pictures of the Caverns.&nbsp; They are wonderful.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC_0351" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0351_small.jpg" width="159" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />On Monday we headed southwest toward El Paso.&nbsp; We stopped and hiked a&nbsp;5 mile trail into McKittrick Canyon which is in the Guadalupe Mountains..&nbsp; This canyon has its own ecological system due to its changing&nbsp;elevation, water supply&nbsp;and protection within the mountains.&nbsp; We saw oak, maple, pine, juniper&nbsp;and chokeberry at the higher elevations and all the regular desert plants such as prickly pear, agave, cholla&nbsp;at the lower elevations.&nbsp; It really was an oasis of green.</p>
<p>We arrived in El Paso late in the afternoon just as the sun was going down and ended up driving through downtown directly into the sun.&nbsp; Sure were glad to get to the campground north of the city.&nbsp; It was right beside American RV where we had the appointment for the next morning at 8:30.</p>
<p>We were treated very promptly and the technician was excellent.&nbsp; They had a little trouble getting a pin to hold but everything seems to work just fine now.&nbsp; The dealership provides free coffee, hot chocolate and danish in the morning and since we were there at lunch time, we&nbsp;also received a&nbsp; free lunch.</p>
<p>Thursday, Feb 8th we headed into New Mexico.&nbsp; We are getting further north now and the nights are starting to get very cold.&nbsp; It was just&nbsp;a little over&nbsp;0 C in El Paso so it&rsquo;s nice to have a good furnace.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be in touch in a bit.</p>
