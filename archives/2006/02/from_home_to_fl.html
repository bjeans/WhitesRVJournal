<h3>From Home to Florida</h3>

<p>December 7th dawned bright and sunny and we anticipated&nbsp;a morning&nbsp;start.&nbsp; But, we had been sitting at the park in Waterloo since we had picked up the new trailer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had snowed and melted and snowed and melted those few days and left a layer of ice on the top of the slides.&nbsp; When we went to close them &ndash; no way &ndash; the layer of ice was in the way.&nbsp; Two hours later and much cracking with a hammer&nbsp;and scrapping with a windshield scraper we had them cleared and started south.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Just south of Erie, PA it started to snow and as the days are short, it was dark. We headed to a WalMart parking lot in Meadville PA. for the night as there were no campgrounds open at that time of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;parked at the edge of the lot, didn&rsquo;t even put the slides out as we didn&rsquo;t want to have snow accumulation on them and went to bed early.&nbsp; All was fine until about 3 AM when the snow clearing crew arrived to do the parking lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning everything around and close to our trailer was clear &ndash; right down to the pavement where they had scraped the snow away.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t have to move but it sure was noisy for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The next day we got as far as Ft. Chiswell VA.&nbsp; We had been hearing about a huge storm that was to arrive that night and tried to get as far south as we could to outrun the snow.&nbsp; We went into a campground there&nbsp;and had just finished hooking up the electricity when the freezing rain started.&nbsp; I must say we were happy to be off the road at that point.&nbsp; The next morning we found about an inch of freezing rain/snow mixture on the slides &ndash; so back up on the ladder with hammer and scraper again.&nbsp; We stayed another night there to be sure that the roads were OK when we headed out.&nbsp; That was the last of the snow that we have seen on this trip!</p>
<p>Our route took us to Greenville, NC where we visited with Ross&rsquo;s cousin for a couple of days and then south through Myrtle Beach, SC to south of Charleston.</p>
<p>From there we went&nbsp;south to Folkston GA.&nbsp; This was a double stop as it is a major railroad intersection and is also&nbsp;an entrance to the Okefenokee swamp.&nbsp; Ross got to watch his trains.&nbsp; We were&nbsp;almost too close as the track ran right beside the campground and there were trains about every 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The next morning we went to Okefenokee swamp.&nbsp; It is an area of more than 600 square miles crossing the southern border of Georgia into Florida.&nbsp; Most of the swamp was declared a wildlife refuge in 1937.&nbsp; There was a 4,000 ft boardwalk extending out into the swamp that ended&nbsp;with a 50 ft high viewing tower.&nbsp; We saw our first alligator of the trip, sunning himself close to the boardwalk.</p>
<p>The main reason that we went down the eastern seaboard was to reach Florida for a holiday with our girls, their husbands and of course our new Ricardo.</p>
<p><img height="225" alt="CA45KTS7" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/CA45KTS7_small1.jpg" width="300" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We spent the week of December 17th to the 24th with our family at a timeshare quite close to the Disney parks.&nbsp; Some visited them, we all went to Kennedy Space Centre, we all shopped and spent a lot of time together.</p>
<p>I decided to cook a full Christmas dinner which was quite a challenge with the small stove in the timeshare.&nbsp; However, a 17lb turkey (at 38 cents a pound !!!) with all the trimmings was enjoyed and devoured.</p>
<p>Mandi &amp; Quincy had to fly back to the Bahamas on the 24th so they could catch the last flight of the day to San Salvador as Bahamas Air doesn&rsquo;t fly on Christmas Day.&nbsp; Barn and Shell stayed with us in the trailer Christmas&nbsp;Eve as we had to check out of the timeshare on the 24th and they couldn&rsquo;t get a flight until the 25th.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was neat having them with us for Christmas morning.</p>
<p>Our Ricardo has grown and as you can see by the picture I&nbsp;looked after him whenever I could.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll miss seeing our family but the road calls and we will be off again on December 27th.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;re heading all the way around the Gulf of Mexico so will keep you posted.</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>
