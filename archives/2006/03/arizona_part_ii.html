<h3>Arizona - Part II</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 288px; HEIGHT: 184px" height="208" alt="IMG_3590_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3590_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 272px; HEIGHT: 182px" height="213" alt="DSC_0816" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0816_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>East of Yuma we finally found significant agriculture and after the dry of the past few weeks it was a welcome sight.&nbsp; But the green is the result of massive irrigation,&nbsp;while dust storms rage on the land where the plants have not sprouted.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, there are warning signs on the highways&nbsp;about reduced visibility because of blowing dust.&nbsp; We found it interesting that the field workers come in by a bus which also pulls two portable toilets for them.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 304px; HEIGHT: 196px" height="213" alt="DSC_0823" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0823_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Yuma Territorial State Prison,&nbsp;built by the earliest inmates in 1876, was known as &ldquo;the Hell Hole of Arizona&rdquo; and&nbsp;was used as a prison until 1909.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t imagine how&nbsp;hot is must have been&nbsp;in the tiny cells in the Arizona summer. &nbsp;The prison was the setting for Steve McQueen&rsquo;s original 50&rsquo;s TV series &ldquo;Wanted Dead or Alive&rdquo;.&nbsp; It sat at the confluence of the Gila and Colorado Rivers and looked out over the flood plain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuma has warm dry winters and because of this &ldquo;snowbirds&rdquo; descend on it, keeping&nbsp;over 70 RV &amp; trailer parks busy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Yuma is on the California border just north of&nbsp;Mexico&nbsp;and is as far west as we are going on this trip.&nbsp; We&nbsp;headed 80 miles north&nbsp;through the Yuma Proving Grounds where the army stages tank battles and other tests of military equipment, to Quartzsite, which&nbsp;is another area that feels the influx of snowbirds.&nbsp; Literally hundreds of thousands of RV-owners descend on the area in January and February because of the rock and gem show, RV show and Sell-O-Rama&nbsp;(a huge flea market), held then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Escaping the northern winters also is a major draw and they&nbsp;dry camp&nbsp;(no hookups)&nbsp;by the thousands in the desert around the town.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0841" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0841_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />On Sunday, the 12th,&nbsp;we drove up to see Lake Havasu which is about 70 miles further north and&nbsp;was created&nbsp;by the damming of the Colorado River.&nbsp; A most unusual sight &ndash;&nbsp;London Bridge &ndash; spans&nbsp;a channel, which was dug so that&nbsp;the bridge would have something to span.&nbsp; R. McCulloch&nbsp;(the chainsaw manufacturer)&nbsp;bought the bridge in 1967 and had the 10,000 numbered blocks of granite shipped from London, across the Atlantic and put back together here.&nbsp; The bridge now ranks second among Arizona&rsquo;s tourist attractions, after the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br clear="left"><img height="213" alt="DSC_0874_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0874_edited_small2.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>While we were&nbsp;in Quartzsite,&nbsp;a major storm came across the area dropping up to 2 feet of snow in the mountains and significant rain at lower elevations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain on March 11th broke a dry spell of 143 days and the excitement on the radio and TV was amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We in Ontario take the rain for granted &amp; forget sometimes how important&nbsp;it is.&nbsp; On Tuesday March 13th we turned east from Quartzsite to Phoenix.&nbsp; The mountains to the east of the city were beautiful, covered by the new snow.&nbsp; Ross took me out for lunch on the 14th, my birthday, to a great restaurant called &ldquo;Wildflower&rdquo;.&nbsp; If you ever get a chance &ndash; go!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Both of us found Phoenix to be a very impressive city with wide clean streets and wonderful views of the mountains.&nbsp; The majority of the houses do not have lawns as the landscaping is&nbsp;desert plants and trees and no grass.&nbsp; It makes for a totally different look in the residential areas.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC_0894_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0894_edited_small.jpg" width="159" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />After a couple of days, we continued north and stayed for two nights in the parking lot of Cliff Castle Casino just north of Camp&nbsp;Verde. The first afternoon we visited Montezuma&rsquo;s Castle, a pink adobe cliff dwelling that was originally reached by 3 separate ladders from the valley floor.&nbsp; The sycamore beams are apparently still in place, and the fingerprints of the Indian masons are still visible on the bricks, but visitors are not allowed to climb up.&nbsp; It is believed that this dwelling is over 700 years old and no one knows why it was abandoned.</p>
<p>The next day we went to Sedona. As you drive toward it through Oak Creek the red cliffs overpower you.&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is quite neat with high class (read expensive) shops.&nbsp;&nbsp;We even found another Wildflower for lunch!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to let the pictures of the area speak for themselves.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 316px; HEIGHT: 240px" height="239" alt="IMG_3631_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3631_edited_small.jpg" width="316" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_3629_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3629_edited_small.jpg" width="180" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 348px; HEIGHT: 257px" height="236" alt="IMG_3628_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3628_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 180px; HEIGHT: 259px" height="240" alt="DSC_0962_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0962_edited_small.jpg" width="159" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We left our contribution at the casino and headed north and east past Flagstaff to Gallup, New Mexico.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t take the time to go further north to the Grand Canyon as we have visited it twice before.&nbsp;&nbsp;We did drive through the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert which is only a short detour off I-40.&nbsp; Apparently petrified wood is found in every state, but the sheer abundance of it in this area of Arizona is extraordinary.&nbsp; The trees date back 225 million years and didn&rsquo;t originate here but accumulated like a log jam in an ancient river.&nbsp; Bit by bit, buried in layers of silt and ash, silica seeped in to the original wood cells and crystallized into quartz.&nbsp; The colours are amazing.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 281px; HEIGHT: 174px" height="213" alt="DSC_0979_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0979_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 275px; HEIGHT: 174px" height="213" alt="DSC_0990_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0990_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><br clear="right">Leaving the Petrified Forest you drive through the Painted Desert, a poorly defined area of multi-coloured badlands that covers much of northeast Arizona.&nbsp; It supports little vegetation or life of any kind and continues to erode at a fearsome rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 337px; HEIGHT: 241px" height="213" alt="DSC_1024" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1024_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="DSC_1018_edited" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1018_edited_small.jpg" width="164" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We stopped just inside the New Mexico border that evening and will head toward Santa Fe tomorrow.</p>

<p>Have always wanted to see Sedona--good friends just returned from spending a week there and a week in Phoenix--not in a RV.   They just sold theirs but with RCI.  Anyway, your pictures, as always were fantastic.   Have a very safe trip home.</p>

<p>Sincerely, Bette</p>
