<h3>To Mexico & back</h3>

<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0742_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0742_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We headed west and stopped for two nights in Gila (pronounced HEE&ndash;la) Bend. </p>
<p>There are some striking rock formations in southern Arizona.&nbsp; They rear up from the flat plain and are really piles of rock rubble&ndash; mind you, BIG piles of rubble.&nbsp; In general the roads go around them.</p>
<p>We finally made the decision go south&nbsp;into Mexico.&nbsp; We have never been there before and really don&rsquo;t know what to expect but in talking to other RVers everything sounds&nbsp;fine, especially&nbsp;in the area we are headed to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the way south, we visited Organ Pipe National Monument which is just above the Mexico border.&nbsp; The name comes from&nbsp;a type of cactus, which looks like church organ pipes, like the one shown.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 300px; HEIGHT: 221px" height="213" alt="DSC_0769_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0769_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 299px; HEIGHT: 223px" height="250" alt="DSC_0755_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0755_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>When going into Mexico you need&nbsp;Mexican vehicle liability insurance.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t check anything at the border but if you are stopped or have an accident and can&rsquo;t produce the certificate you will probably go to jail and your vehicle will be confiscated.&nbsp; We obviously bought some.&nbsp; You can buy the insurance at the border, at gas stations, convenience stores &ndash; just about anywhere.&nbsp; It was $56.00 for 10 days coverage.</p>
<p>As we were not&nbsp;going further than the &ldquo;free zone&rdquo; we didn&rsquo;t need a visa or visitor&rsquo;s permit.&nbsp; The &ldquo;free zone&rdquo; is a defined distance from the border and includes designated tourist areas and access routes.&nbsp; The crossing was easy, they just waved us through and didn&rsquo;t even look at our passports.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="220" alt="DSC_0790_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0790_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We stayed on the south side of the town of&nbsp;Puerto Penasco which is about 100 km south of the US border, right on the Sea of Cortez (the water that separates mainland Mexico from the Baja Peninsula).&nbsp; It is a very Americanised community&nbsp;where English is spoken most everywhere and the US dollar is accepted readily.&nbsp; The exchange is usually 10 pesos to $1.00.&nbsp; Our campground was right on the ocean although our site was back a bit.&nbsp; This picture is from the top of a hill between our campground and Old Port looking down at the beach (the right edge of the picture).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The land&nbsp;is&nbsp;very flat&nbsp;although there are hills of rock&nbsp;that rise from the plain like islands.&nbsp; This is very similar to southern Arizona.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dry here.&nbsp; We thought that Arizona was dry but this is even more so. The only place you see&nbsp;vegetation of any size is along the washes where the water accumulates when it does rain.</p>
<p>One day we travelled about 60 km&nbsp;south of town&nbsp;but finally turned around at a police checkpoint as the next community was still a further 50 km and there was nothing but desert to see.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0792_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0792_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Puerto Penasco is exploding with construction &ndash; hotels, condos, high end houses &ndash; but it is still a fishing village with the shrimp boats going out every day.&nbsp; There is a wonderful harbour and across it, outside of town, is Sandy Beach which is now lined with&nbsp;expensive condo timeshare resorts.&nbsp; The town itself is a combination of the old and the new.&nbsp; The older&nbsp;area &ndash; Old Port &ndash; has had a lot of upgrading done to streets and public areas.&nbsp; The areas outside Old Port are a mixture of wonderful new homes right beside plywood shacks.&nbsp; The construction&nbsp;on the buildings never seems to to be finished and we found out that&nbsp;is because taxes&nbsp;become payable on completion.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0805_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0805_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We enjoyed our stay, had lots of Mexican food, wandered the markets, walked along the beach, took a&nbsp;resort sales tour (they paid us $100 and a free lunch) and enjoyed the warm weather and sun.&nbsp; The water in Puerto Penasco is fine to drink so no problem there.&nbsp; It averaged about 75 F in the day and&nbsp;cooled off nicely in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All gas stations are Pemex and state owned.&nbsp; Mexico uses the metric system&nbsp;so the gas was priced&nbsp;by the&nbsp;litre&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;51.3 cents.&nbsp; WOW!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to go back and travel further into Mexico the next time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now we are heading back to the US and our next destination is Yuma in the very south west corner of Arizona.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll backtrack through Gila Bend as we have been advised by locals that the Mexican highway&nbsp;along the border is not very good for RVs.&nbsp; Better safe than sorry.</p>

<p>WE woke up to about 4 inches of snow this a.m. and it is still a mix of snow and rain now so believe me your pictures with sunshine and talk of temps in the 70's were really pleasant.  Have never been to Mexico--always been apprehensive about going there but that area looked very nice.  Send some warm weather this way.</p>

<p>Sincerely, Bette</p>
