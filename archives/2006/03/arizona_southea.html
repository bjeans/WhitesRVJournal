<h3>Arizona Southeast</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_3566_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3566_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Chiricahua National Monument is at an elevation ranging from 5,180 to7,825 feet in mountains that rise above the surrounding grasslands. &nbsp;This was Chiricahua Apache country. Led by warriors such as Cochise and Geronimo, they were the last Native Americans to hold out against the US Army in later 1800s..&nbsp; On Monday, Feb 13th we travelled on a rough unpaved road over Apache Pass from Bowie where we were were camped.&nbsp; You can also go around the mountain range on a paved road but it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have the same feel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hiked a&nbsp;3 mile tail in this wonderful area of bizarre rock formations created over the last 27 million years.&nbsp; The forces of erosion have sculpted this 2,000 foot layer of fused volcanic ash into an odd array of&nbsp;strange towers and columns of stacked and balanced stones.&nbsp; No wonder the Apaches could just disappear here.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 310px; HEIGHT: 204px" height="213" alt="DSC_0523_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0523_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 313px; HEIGHT: 205px" height="213" alt="DSC_0559" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0559_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="225" alt="DSC_0599_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0599_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Tuesday we moved to Tombstone and in the afternoon&nbsp;went to the Shootout at the OK&nbsp;Corral.&nbsp; A bit of fun in an interesting town that has kept the main street quite authentic.&nbsp; We went for lunch at Big Nose Kates (she was Doc Holliday&rsquo;s lady friend) and wandered around the graveyard where&nbsp;Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers are buried.&nbsp; The gravestones for the years 1881 and 1882 seem to show that the majority of those being buried were murdered, killed in shootouts or &ldquo;found dead&rdquo;.&nbsp; Not good years in that town.</p>
<p>The next day we travelled further south to the town of Bisbee which by 1900, wa<img height="213" alt="DSC_0614" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0614_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />s the largest cosmopolitan center between St. Louis and San Francisco.&nbsp; This was because of the discovery of the Copper Queen Lode.&nbsp; Over the years the Bisbee mines produced&nbsp;more than $2 billion in copper, gold, lead, silver and zinc.&nbsp; By the 1970s most of the mines had closed but artists, art galleries and studios have taken over the town.&nbsp; They have also preserved alot of the Victorian architecture of the town.&nbsp; We took a town tour which included a visit to the open pit mine seen on the right.&nbsp; The pit is 950 feet deep.&nbsp; The slag from the mines is about 3% copper.&nbsp; The town&nbsp;expects Phelps Dodge to come back to reprocess the slag, as with the current price of copper, it is now economical at concentrations of only 1 1/2%.</p>
<p>We arrived in Tuscon on Thursday, Feb 16th.&nbsp; Both of my sisters are on holidays in the southwest during February.&nbsp; Joan is in Tuscon and Madeline in Mesa.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great to get to see them.&nbsp; With us on the road, it is harder to get together with family so we take the opportunity when we can.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;spent a week in Tuscon and visited the historic downtown,&nbsp;took a day off to do nothing, got a hair cut, did a number of loads of wash and went to Joan&rsquo;s for dinner.&nbsp; On&nbsp;Monday, Madeline &amp; George came down from Mesa and&nbsp;the next day we all went to Nogales Mexico.&nbsp; It was fun bartering with the shop keepers &ndash; a real battle of wills.&nbsp; We stopped at a casino on the way home and left our contribution to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0685_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0685_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />On Wednesday&nbsp;we went out to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum and then to Saguaro National Park.&nbsp; The Museum is a combination of zoo and plants that thrive here in the Sonoran Desert region.&nbsp; The Saguaro cactus are everywhere.&nbsp; We learned that they can live to be up to 200 years old and grow very slowly.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t usually even produce &ldquo;arms&rdquo; until they are at least 35 years old.&nbsp; They absorb water when it rains&nbsp;but there has been a terrible drought and right now they are quite slender.&nbsp; A good rain can&nbsp;provide them with enough water for them to live on for up to 2 years. <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="255" alt="DSC_0701_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0701_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The Tuscon Rodeo was in town and the parade was&nbsp;on Thursday Feb. 23rd.&nbsp; We were amazed.&nbsp; The Rodeo is so important that the schools were closed for two days &ndash; the Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>It is the largest non motorized parade in the country and there were 114 entries in the parade.&nbsp; Talk about horse power!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, it was a great parade and there were 10s of thousands of people out to watch it.</p>
<p><br clear="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="206" alt="DSC_0733_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0733_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Before we left Tuscon, Ross took a tour of the Aircraft Maintenance and Regeneration Centre at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nicknamed &ldquo;the boneyard&rdquo;. &nbsp;This is one of the areas where the U.S. Armed Forces send their surplus or obsolete planes for&nbsp;storage, parts or demolition. &nbsp;The tour took him right out among approximately 5,000 planes.</p>
<p>We are now heading west along Interstate 8.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t decided whether to go into Mexico or not.&nbsp; I guess we had better make up our minds soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
