<h3>Nova Scotia - from A to A (Amherst to Annapolis Royal)</h3>

<p><img height="176" alt="DSC_1683_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1683_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Arriving in Nova Scotia, you&nbsp;pass through&nbsp;farmland that&nbsp;was reclaimed from the&nbsp;vast Tantramar Marsh by the 18th century Acadians, by a series of dykes.&nbsp; We saw similar series of dykes around Grand Pre just outside Wolfville, NS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The town of Amherst, a centre of wealth and influence,&nbsp;was home to four of the Fathers of Canadian Confederation. <br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_3939_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3939_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />From Truro we took the highway that hugged the water of Minas Basin which is the south east arm of the Bay of Fundy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before&nbsp;South Maitland we crossed the Shubenacadie River almost at low tide.&nbsp; The river is&nbsp;huge with wide sand bars and wet silt and is tidal, miles from the bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;We crossed the river 21 miles upstream and at that point you could see that the tides could still rise 20 &ndash; 25 ft.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We followed Highway 215 (the Glooscap Trail)&nbsp; that continues along the coast.&nbsp; It is a disgrace to the province of Nova Scotia and is actually dangerous to pull a trailer over.&nbsp; It has&nbsp;patches on patches on patches on patches, huge chunks of the edges of the pavement missing,&nbsp;six inch drops from the pavement to the shoulder in the few places there is any kind of shoulder.&nbsp; It was so bad that unfortunately it made us hesitant to try other similar roads while pulling the trailer.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 270px; HEIGHT: 186px" height="236" alt="IMG_3948_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3948_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 272px; HEIGHT: 188px" height="240" alt="IMG_3974_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3974_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We made our base just south of Kentville at an excellent campground and on Wed. Sept 14th we toured the area.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to Hall&rsquo;s Harbour for low tide in the morning and then returned about 6 hours later for high tide.&nbsp; The tides around here are the highest in the world, reaching greater than 30 ft.&nbsp; We took pictures of the same scene at both times.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1727_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1727_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;In Ontario we call them "look outs" &ndash; in Nova Scotia they are Look Offs and there is a wonderful one just up from Wolfville.&nbsp; The view is over the lush agricultural land of the Annapolis Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;The valley&nbsp;nestles between South Mountain and North Mountain &ndash; ridges that run parallel to the river.&nbsp; North Mountain protects the valley from the winds from the north coming across the Bay of Fundy and Minas Basin.&nbsp; We stocked up on the wonderful produce of the area.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1755" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1755_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Annapolis Royal is one of the oldest European settlements in Canada. In 1605 the area was settled by a small group of French explorers two years before Jamestown, Virginia, three years before the founding of Quebec, and fifteen years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Mass.&nbsp; During the 150 year struggle for control of the continent, the area changed hands seven times between the French and English .&nbsp; In 1710 the British captured Port Royal and renamed it Annapolis Royal after Queen Anne.&nbsp;&nbsp; The downtown area is a National Historic District.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="213" alt="DSC_1758" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1758_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We visited Fort Anne which still has a few of the original stone buildings.&nbsp; It stood guard at the mouth of the Annapolis River which was a gateway into the interior.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also visited North America&rsquo;s only tidal power generating station.&nbsp; The huge power of the tides is harnessed twice a day. As the tide goes out, the generating station produces and then feeds power into the Nova Scotia power grid.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are staying at a campground just outside Digby and I&rsquo;ll write more about that area in the next journal</p>
<p>Till then &ndash; take care</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>

<p>Hello<br />
Just keep learning more from you about the area. Still writing everything down--we will not have the time you do but your information and pictures are invaluable.  Every area looks gorgeous!  Looking forward to the next chapter.<br />
Sincerely, Bette</p>
