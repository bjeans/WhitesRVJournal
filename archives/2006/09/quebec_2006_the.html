<h3>Quebec 2006 - The St. Lawrence River</h3>

<p>We left southern Ontario&nbsp;in the first part of the afternoon on Wed. August 16th and&nbsp;spent our first night&nbsp;at Long Sault just west of Cornwall at a beautiful campground in the Parks of the St. Lawrence.&nbsp; The next day we crossed the St. Lawrence river west of Montreal and stayed near the town of Delsen so that Ross could visit the newly renovated and expanded&nbsp; Exporail which was formerly known as the Canadian Railway Museum.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="Quebec2" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Quebec2_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We stayed on the south shore which seems to be much flatter than the north as we were soon able to see large hills showing up across the water.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We stayed&nbsp;in Levis, which is connected to Quebec City by two bridges and ferries.&nbsp; The view of the Chateau Frontenac from the heights of Levis is outstanding.&nbsp; On Saturday, we visited nearby farms where we stocked up on local strawberries, corn, blueberries, tomatoes and beans.&nbsp; We also went to a local cheese shop and got curd and pepper goat cheese.&nbsp; I am becoming quite adept at fitting everything into my&nbsp;8 cu. ft. refrigerator.<br clear="left">
<p>Sunday, the 20th, we headed northwest following the river.&nbsp; It is narr<img height="194" alt="Quebec Farms" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Quebec_20Farms_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />ow at Quebec, then splits around Ile d&rsquo;Orleans and widens&nbsp;as we continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ile d&rsquo;Orleans&nbsp;can be seen quite easily, with its wonderful farms sloping gently to the water.&nbsp; As we travel the south shore we are impressed by the quality of the land and the farms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are following Hwy 132, which we picked up when we crossed into Quebec and we will follow it all the way around the Gaspe.&nbsp; It is the local highway and in general is the road closest to the river.&nbsp; It has a variety of surfaces and they range from excellent to terrible.&nbsp; We have a new shock absorbing hitch that seems to be working.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t feel the back and forth jerking of the trailer as much as before so it makes for a better ride in the truck.&nbsp; However, it does seem to shake the contents of the inside of the trailer&nbsp;so I end up with more things on the floor.&nbsp; Guess, I&rsquo;ll have to batten down the hatches better.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="Quebec House" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Quebec_20House_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Kamouraska is a small town about half way between Quebec City and Riviere-du-Loup and has to be one of the prettiest towns in the province.&nbsp; We have been very impressed by the wonderful stone houses with their flowers and impeccable landscaping.&nbsp; In fact, the whole quality of care as we travel this highway is impressive. This house is very typical of what we have seen&nbsp;and note the swoop to the roof at the eaves.&nbsp; I guess the only thing that is missing&nbsp;is a&nbsp;red roof that&nbsp;is so typical in this province.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="IMG_3803_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3803_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_3812_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3812_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>At Trois Pistoles we parked right on the shore of the St. Lawrence.&nbsp; The river is widening now and we are losing the details of the far shore. It is also tidal here and there was a wonderful sunset at low tide.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we went hiking in Parc du Bic &ndash; it&rsquo;s good to get out walking as we sit so long in the truck&nbsp;when we are on the move.</p>
<p>At the campground in Matane we met up with a RV Caravan that had come across the St. Lawrence (which is 62 km wide here)&nbsp;on the ferry from Baie-Comeau.&nbsp; Turns out it was being led by&nbsp;the&nbsp;organizers of&nbsp;the&nbsp;&ldquo; Safe RV&rsquo;ing&rdquo; caravan that we participated in, in the spring of 2004.&nbsp; We spent the evening with one of the couples that had also been on that caravan.&nbsp; What a great chance meeting!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 171px; HEIGHT: 253px" height="240" alt="Windmills" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Windmills_small.jpg" width="159" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 381px; HEIGHT: 256px" height="207" alt="Lighthouse and sea wall" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Lighthouse_20and_20sea_20wall_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The next day we took the tour of a &ldquo;windmill farm&rdquo; and now are even more impressed with the size and intricate simplicity of this energy source.&nbsp; The mountains now&nbsp;come right down to the water and the new road is built for miles and miles right beside it and is protected by huge sea walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are now headed right out to the end of Gaspe and I&rsquo;ll continue the journal from there</p>
<p>Till then</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>
