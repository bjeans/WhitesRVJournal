<h3>New Brunswick 2006 - Sussex Balloon Festival.</h3>

<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1635_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1635_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of Sussex, half way between Moncton and Fredericton hosts a balloon festival each fall.</p>
<p>Fortunately, on the Friday night the balloons were able to lift off, even though there was more than an hour&rsquo;s delay until the wind died down.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1637_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1637_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the burners are fired to start filling them with air, the balloons seem to rise like some huge animals rousing from their sleep.<br clear="right">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1639_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1639_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The first one is in the air!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>There is really no control over where the balloon goes.&nbsp; The pilot can control how high or low, by adjusting the flame and that does give a little measure of direction &ndash; but the chase cars have to&nbsp;go after&nbsp;them as they don&rsquo;t land in a particular spot.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 228px; HEIGHT: 259px" height="240" alt="DSC_1662_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1662_edited_small.jpg" width="208" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is called Honey Bear <br clear="right">
<p><img height="290" alt="DSC_1663_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1663_edited_small2.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is Old MacDonald's Farm&nbsp;<br clear="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1647_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1647_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They come in every colour and pattern and as you can see even some very special shapes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The participants come from all over North America for this festival.&nbsp; It is apparently the last one of the balloon season.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_3928" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3928_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the balloons took flight there was a huge cake &ndash;&nbsp;at least 3&rsquo;x4&rsquo; &ndash; served to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was also an excellent craft exhibit building as well as carnival rides and games and other exhibitors.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="213" alt="DSC_1678_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1678_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Saturday evening a storm blew in just at the time that the balloons should have taken off so they didn&rsquo;t have a flight.&nbsp; They did however have a &ldquo;burn&rdquo; after it got dark and the rain had stopped.</p>
<p>We were all able to see the baskets and burners up close.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s amazing how much heat those burners put out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking a couple of days off &ndash; going over to Shediac to meet RV friends who have been on Newfoundland all summer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been busy so it will be nice to stop for a couple of days and do nothing.</p>
<p>After that we are headed into Nova Scotia.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&lsquo;Til then</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>

<p>Loved the pictures of the balloon festival.  We were there a couple of years ago.  One of the balloons landed in Ken's cousins field.  He owns a large dairy farm at Sussex.  If a balloon lands in your field, you're gifted with a bottle of champagne.  He does rather well each year.<br />
Sounds like a wonderful trip--enjoy!<br />

<p>Hi Bernie & Ross:</p>

<p>Still reading your journal with interest.  </p>

<p>We have been hearing alot lately about RV-ing in Mexico.   In one of your earlier journals you describe your trip through Mexico.  </p>

<p>Can you forward that to me again and can you tell me the pro's and cons about rv-ing in Mexico.</p>

<p>We are planning to go back to Mission.</p>
