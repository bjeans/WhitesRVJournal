<h3>Northern Washington</h3>

<p>Remember back when we were coming through Ontario, Manitoba, North Dakota, Montana and into Yellowstone?&nbsp; All we had was rain and cold.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;other than about an hour of drizzle just before the Redmond rally, we have had wonderful&nbsp;weather since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;The central valleys of&nbsp;California, Oregon and Washington are quite hot in the daytime but cool off beautifully in the evening.&nbsp; We have only used the air conditioning a couple of times &ndash;&nbsp;I think it was in Chico &ndash;&nbsp;to cool the trailer down from the high daytime heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess our decision to go south into Idaho and on from there&nbsp;was the right one!</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0097_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0097_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />When you look at a map of Washington state you will see Puget Sound dips way down to create&nbsp;the Olympic Peninsula&nbsp;to its west.&nbsp; The Sound itself has a large peninsula coming up into it &ndash; the Kitsap.&nbsp; We set up camp at Potlatch State Park on the east side of the Olympic Peninsula looking across the Hood canal at the Kitsap Peninsula.&nbsp; (Hope I&rsquo;ve got everyone going looking for their maps to see where we are)&nbsp; The Olympic mountains to our west are quite different from those that we have been seeing for the last few weeks.&nbsp; These are rocky, rugged and much more angular than the tree covered rounded ones of western Oregon and Washington.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0108_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0108_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="5" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0104_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0104_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="5" border="2" /></p>
<p>One day we decided to go to Seattle across the Kitsap and then by ferry.&nbsp; On the way up to the Hood Canal bridge we took a side trip up Mt. Walker.&nbsp; It was a 7 km gravel road to the 2,804 foot summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the last 3 km was one lane, with pulloffs every so often in case you met someone.&nbsp; Fortunately, we only met one car and we were right at one of the pulloffs.&nbsp; The view was wonderful with panoramic views of Puget Sound, the Olympics and the Cascades.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there were a lot of clouds over the Olympics so we only caught glimpses of them.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 386px; HEIGHT: 222px" height="155" alt="IMG_2959_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2959_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" /></p>
<p>As we travelled east on the ferry toward Seattle, Mt. Rainier towered over the landscape.&nbsp; At 14, 411 feet it is 249 feet higher than Mt. Shasta in California.&nbsp; We were wrong about Mt. Shasta, it is the second highest mountain in the lower United States not North America.&nbsp; Mt. McKinley in Alaska is higher than both Rainier or Shasta.&nbsp; These volcanic mountains are very impressive as they stand alone, high above the other mountains in the area.&nbsp;(It&rsquo;s the white cone on the right, the rest are clouds)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seattle&rsquo;s historic district has been restored beautifully and Pike&rsquo;s Place Market which opened as a farmer&rsquo;s market in 1907 is now very diverse and interesting.&nbsp; While in the Seattle area, we went out to Redmond WA (a suburb ) to drive around the Microsoft campus. And that is what it looks like &ndash; no huge buildings, just lowrise buildings in a setting reminding us of a college campus.&nbsp; Even the parking lots were shaded with lovely trees.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_2955_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2955_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />Olympia, at the south end of Puget Sound is the state capital and we took a tour of the legislative buildings.&nbsp; The building was completed in 1928 and the whole of the interior of the ground and first floors have been constructed of black and white Alaska marble.&nbsp; WOW!&nbsp; The Senate and House chambers are European marble which was brought back as ballast&nbsp;on troop ships during World War 1.&nbsp; The lighting fixtures in the whole building as well as the chandelier that hangs in the rotunda were designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany.&nbsp; The building has a 287 ft masonry dome, one of the largest in the world.&nbsp; This is probably the most impressive state capital we have seen &ndash; and we now have seen them all except Alaska &amp; Hawaii.</p>
<p>We packed up on Sunday morning, July 24th &nbsp;and headed around Puget Sound expecting the traffic to be relatively light.&nbsp; No such luck &ndash; you would have thought that it was a weekday rush hour as we passed Seattle, and we took the bypass.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Our final&nbsp;location in the U.S.&nbsp;was Mt. Vernon just 60 miles north of Seattle and 55 miles south of the border.&nbsp; As you can imagine, when we arrive in an area and turn on the television, we have no idea what station we may be&nbsp;tuning in&nbsp;to.&nbsp; In Mt. Vernon, the first TV station&nbsp;we turned on&nbsp;had a Tim Hortons&rsquo; commercial.&nbsp; We knew we were close to Canada!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s amazing how different the U.S. commercials are from Canadian.&nbsp; We got so tired of being bombarded by medical commercials with all their &ldquo;cover your backside&rdquo; disclaimers.&nbsp; What a pleasure to hear about coffee.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0110_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0110_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We did go sightseeing to the islands just west of Mt. Vernon.&nbsp; On a huge bridge over Deception Pass (passage)we watched two tugs maneuver a huge log boom through the pass.&nbsp; One tug pulled the boom and the other would push or pull the end of the boom to give it additional direction. We tried to calculate how many&nbsp;logs there might be and later learned there could be as many as 5 to 10 thousand logs (trees) in one log boom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing on the bridge we could look directly west and see land.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;Canada, in the general vicinity of Victoria.&nbsp; Even with binoculars it was too hazy to make out details.&nbsp; On the way back to camp, we went though some wonderful&nbsp; market gardening areas.&nbsp; We also made a quick stop at the Casino &ndash; it should have been quicker &ndash; to leave our contribution.&nbsp; Well, actually Bernie came out $4.00 ahead.</p>
<p>On Wednesday we will be heading home to Canada.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re glad.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a&nbsp;wonderful trip so far and we have met and made friends with some&nbsp;great people.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; it will be nice to be back with familiar stores and products, Canadian money and Tim Hortons.<br clear="left"></p>
