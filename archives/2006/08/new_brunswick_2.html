<h3>New Brunswick 2006  to PEI</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 234px; HEIGHT: 274px" height="240" alt="DSC_1465_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1465_edited_small.jpg" width="159" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Although we have been&nbsp;to the east coast&nbsp;a number of times, we have never visited the Acadian Peninsula, so from Campbellton we followed the Baie des Chaleurs to Caraquet.&nbsp; On the way we stayed at Jacquet River where once again we were dazzled by the sunset over the water.</p>
<p>The campground was run by the municipality and was very nicely set up.&nbsp; They only charged $1.00 for a load of wash (cold water) and the drying was free.&nbsp; We often pay $1.50 to $2.00 per load for each.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p>Caraquet was established in 1758 as Capital de l&rsquo;Acadie and is the oldest French settlement in <img height="213" alt="DSC_1468_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1468_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />northern New Brunswick.&nbsp; It is home to a huge fishing fleet and also outside the town is Village Historique Acadien which interprets the lives of the Acadians from 1770 through 1939.&nbsp; Interpreters in period costumes bring it to life.&nbsp; We had lunch there, eating soup made from ingredients grown in the village (every house had a garden) and eating bread baked by women&nbsp;from the&nbsp;houses in the village.&nbsp; Most of the buildings are authentic Acadian structures, transported to the site and restored.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC_1477_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1477_edited_small1.jpg" width="143" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We&nbsp;drove to the very tip of Miscou Island.&nbsp; We could see the Gaspe Peninsula to the north west but looking to the east into the Gulf there was no land to be seen.&nbsp; The lighthouse at the tip of the island, is the original octagonal tower that&nbsp;was erected in 1856, is made of wood and is still in operation as a&nbsp;manned light.&nbsp;&nbsp; Miscou Island is very flat and the province is&nbsp;building a new ecological boardwalk that circles a pond as it goes out into the plains of the island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get to Miscou Island we passed through Shippagan a busy commercial fishing centre.&nbsp; The fishing boats lined up out of the water looked like some kind of colourful navy.&nbsp; We presume they are waiting for the&nbsp;season to begin again.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 525px; HEIGHT: 118px" height="159" alt="DSC_1475_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1475_edited_small2.jpg" width="640" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also around the Shippagan area are massive peat bogs that are commercially harvested.&nbsp; We tried, but because of how flat they are, the pictures didn&rsquo;t show anything.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1531" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1531_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />The Acadian houses are very colourful and the red, white and blue flag with the gold star in the upper left corner is everywhere.&nbsp; French, as well as English,&nbsp;is spoken&nbsp;throughout this&nbsp;region.&nbsp;&nbsp; How truly wonderful to be so bilingual.&nbsp;The people of the area slip between the two languages apparently without even thinking about it.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p>We only had a&nbsp;couple days in the area and then carried on toward PEI through towns with such wonderful names as Miramichi, Richibucto, Bouctouce and Shediac.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be in touch from the other side of the Confederation Bridge.</p>

<p>I just keeping tracking your trip only now have a map of that region which is easier then the atlas.  I thought they were the maritime provinces but have since learned they are the Atlantic provinces.  Your pictures are gorgeous and your information is really going to be helpful for us next summer.  Sounds as if you are having a terrific time--anxious for next part.  We are going to OR. coast tomorrow for 6 days.  Sincerely, Bette</p>
