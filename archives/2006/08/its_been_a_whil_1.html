<h2>August 19, 2006</h2>

<h3>It's been a while!</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re on the road again!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send a journal in a week or so to cover the first part of our trip which will eventually take us to the Maritime Provinces.&nbsp; We will not have time this trip to go to Newfoundland as we will be back home to Cambridge for&nbsp;early October.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="275" alt="With lego_edited" hspace="8" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/With_20lego_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Mandi, Quincy and Ricardo are once again coming home for the Thanksgiving&nbsp;holiday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe but&nbsp;Ricardo will be a little over a year old when we next see him.&nbsp; Time sure does fly!&nbsp; This is a picture of Ricky at Easter.&nbsp; We think he is wonderful, but then perhaps we are a little prejudiced.</p>
<p>Mandi expects that he will be walking by the time they get here as he crawls everywhere and walks along the furniture whenever possible.</p>
<p><br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_3707_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3707_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We have had a good summer.&nbsp; We stayed at Green Acre Park in Waterloo for the month of April and then transfered to a quite new park, Flamboro Valley Camping Resort, just&nbsp;west of Hwy 6 on Hwy 97 east of Cambridge.&nbsp; The folks, Doug &amp; Irene, John &amp; Margaret,&nbsp;were great and we became quite involved with activities in the park.&nbsp; This was only the 3rd full season for the park and&nbsp;they are continuing to expand quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s on my recommended parks list.&nbsp; I also want to recommend our neighbors, Jim &amp; Debbie as well as Mickey across the way.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;the&nbsp;campground&nbsp;is&nbsp;out in the country we had some wonderful sunsets and cloud formations.&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as being a very good park, it was also only 20 minutes from Barnaby and Michelle&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>We have been busy.&nbsp; We did a lot of landscaping at Barn &amp; Shell&rsquo;s as they decided that the front yard was too overgrown for their liking.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been professionally landscaped when the house was new, 14 or so years ago, but as&nbsp;everyone knows, trees, shrubs etc do keep on growing.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still more to do next year but they&nbsp;seem happy with our work&nbsp;(and so are we).</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC00731 (2)" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC00731_20_282_29_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />I&nbsp;really missed painting with my Wed. group in Toronto so started looking for other artists in the area of the park.&nbsp; I found a group in Milton that paints Wednesday during the day and&nbsp;joined them.&nbsp; What a pleasure to get back to the paintbrush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to wait to leave on our trip until the middle of August so that I could be in Art Naturally, a juried show that is held annually&nbsp;in the gardens of&nbsp;the Guild&nbsp;Inn in Toronto.&nbsp; As you can see, the setting is wonderful, the weather was exceptional and to top it all off &ndash;&nbsp;I sold 6 paintings!&nbsp; A very successful show!&nbsp; I expect that I will find wonderful vistas as&nbsp;we travel east and should have many new paintings for the next show.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>One day, earlier in the summer, we played tourist in the area.&nbsp; We&nbsp;started the day&nbsp;by going to the St. Jacob&rsquo;s <img height="213" alt="DSC_1164_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1164_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />Farmers Market.&nbsp; If you are ever in the area, make sure that you visit it as there is something there for everyone.&nbsp; In particular are the baked goods and preserves brought in by the Mennonite women &ndash;&nbsp;and of course there is the produce!&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued north to Elmira and from there we followed the back roads through the county, looking at the wonderful Mennonite farms, the Conestoga River and dam and, after a stop in St. Jacob&rsquo;s for ice cream, the West Montrose covered bridge.&nbsp; This is the last covered bridge left in Ontario and has been kept in wonderful condition, considering that the road still goes right&nbsp;through it.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>We will be sorry to be away in September as we will miss being there to&nbsp;support Michelle in her&nbsp;fourth year of walking in the Weekend to End Breast Cancer.&nbsp; As many of you know, in 2003 I lost my youngest sister Faye, to breast cancer.&nbsp; Michelle and Barnaby have&nbsp;concentrated their energies&nbsp;to this battle.&nbsp; Over the past&nbsp;3 years Michelle has walked and Barnaby has &ldquo;crewed&rdquo; &nbsp;in Toronto and they have worked as &ldquo;crew&rdquo; for the walks in Calgary, Winnipeg and Ottawa and London, England.&nbsp; Michelle will be walking 60 km over two days with about 4,500 others.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be thinking of her the weekend of September 9 &amp; 10.&nbsp; If any of you would like to help sponsor her&nbsp;(each walker must raise a minimum of $2,000 to be allowed to walk) please&nbsp;go to her web site link <a href="http://endcancer.jeansfamily.ca">http://endcancer.jeansfamily.ca</a> and follow the instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we are off again.&nbsp; As I write this journal, I am sitting on the banks of the St. Lawrence River, looking at the Chateau Frontenac across the river.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s cloudy, so I don&rsquo;t know how the pictures will turn out, but I&rsquo;ll get back to you again in a few days to bring you up to date.</p>

<p>Oh, I am so glad you are back on the road again.  I really missed all the updates.  As the Maritimes are one of our very favorite places we will enjoy everyone of your commentaries.</p>

<p>Well, seems you are off again having a wondeful time.   I would love to see the Maritime provinces so will be anxious to see your journal.Where you were this summer looked really beautiful.  We have had a warm summer and quite a few fires in the area but they seem to be under control again.   Who is the painter?<br />
