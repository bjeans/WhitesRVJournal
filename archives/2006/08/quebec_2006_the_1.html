<h3>Quebec 2006 - The Gaspe Peninsula</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 316px; HEIGHT: 208px" height="213" alt="Gaspe - the hills" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gaspe_20_2D_20the_20hills_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 312px; HEIGHT: 209px" height="213" alt="Gaspe - Coast Guard Lighthouse" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gaspe_20_2D_20Coast_20Guard_20Lighthouse_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>On Tuesday, August 22 right around&nbsp;Madeleine-Centre&nbsp;we made the turn from travelling north east to south east.&nbsp; The St. Lawrence is still a river, but thinks it&rsquo;s and ocean, it&rsquo;s so huge.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather has been fine and the air is so clear &ndash; sunny days but chilly nights (actually quite cold).&nbsp; Our view of the hills and the ocean is constant with Coast Guard stations and lighthouses on headlands&nbsp;and small villages tucked into the shore.</p>
<p>As we continued to the end of the Gaspe peninsula we&nbsp;passed through&nbsp;Cap-des-Rosiers, which&nbsp;for sailors is the demarcation point between the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The road goes right through Forillon National Park, at the very tip of the peninsula.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="180" alt="Village on the south shore" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Village_20on_20the_20south_20shore_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Of interest to our RVing friends &ndash;&nbsp;this last part of the road has been quite challenging.&nbsp; We have had numerous grades of 10 to 14% and one quite long one of 18%.&nbsp; On that one, we could smell the brakes by the time we reached the bottom.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p>We spent the night of the 23rd in the town of Gaspe and&nbsp;with a population of 15,000 it is the major community for this part of the province.&nbsp; It has a huge natural harbour and when Jacques Cartier sailed into it in 1534&nbsp;he erected a cross claiming Canada for France.</p>
<p><img height="160" alt="Perce - first view" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Perce_20_2D_20first_20view_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>About 70 km further, as you come over a hill and drive around one more bend, there it is Perce rock,&nbsp;one of the most recognizable natural attractions in the country.&nbsp; We have seen it a couple of times before but it is&nbsp;still an amazing sight.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We stayed at a campground&nbsp;right in the&nbsp;village of Perce and walked from there to the downtown area and out to the rock.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>The tide was low the following morning so we went as far as possible without getting wet.&nbsp; At times the tide has a big enough swing that you can walk on dry land right to the rock, but not the day we were there.&nbsp;It is huge! The limestone rock is&nbsp;1,545 feet long by 288 feet high and was formed about 375 million years ago.<img height="213" alt="Perce at low tide" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Perce_20at_20low_20tide_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 301px; HEIGHT: 212px" height="240" alt="Perce from the water" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Perce_20from_20the_20water_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parc national de l&rsquo;Ile-Bonaventure is an island about 2 miles off the coast and is recognized as the most significant Northern Gannet colony in North America.&nbsp; More than 110 thousand Gannets and other rare species nest on the island every year.&nbsp; It is a now a protected area with clearly marked walking trails.&nbsp; We took a&nbsp;boat tour out around&nbsp;Perce rock and then were&nbsp;dropped off at the island.&nbsp; The drop off point is&nbsp;on the opposite side&nbsp;from where the Gannet colony&nbsp;is and the shortest trail is 2.8 km directly across the island.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Gannet chick with adult" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gannet_20chick_20with_20adult_small.jpg" width="227" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 347px; HEIGHT: 240px" height="213" alt="Gannet colony" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gannet_20colony_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="245" alt="Pair of Gannets" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Pair_20of_20Gannets_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The noise of thousands of these big birds &ndash; the wingspan is about 6 ft. and the body length about 3 ft. &ndash; is almost overpowering.&nbsp; There are always birds taking off or landing as they dive for fish from up to 100 ft above the surface of the ocean.&nbsp; They pair for life and return to the same spot every year to make their nest.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine how they can possibly find it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The trail leads right to the colony and they can be viewed from a few feet away.&nbsp;&nbsp; We took a different trail (3.5 km) back that took us past some of the abandoned houses that once belonged to fishermen on the island.&nbsp;&nbsp; The province is gradually restoring some of these buildings.</p>
<p>We left Perce on Saturday Aug. 26 and headed along the north shore of the Baie des Chaleurs.&nbsp; Once again we are impressed by the care and colours of the homes.&nbsp; Our impression of the Gaspesie Tourist Region is one of quality and beauty.(They could use some work on the&nbsp;road surfaces, though).&nbsp; It has taken us 10 days to travel about 1,850 km and we have enjoyed it all.</p>
<p>We are on the way to Campbellton, New Brunswick and will write from there.</p>

<p>What gorgeous country--have the locations written down and will check them out again in the Atlas.  We have made reservations at a time-share in Quebec for a week in June, 07 and then will spend another week traveling in the Maritime provinces before going to Maine for a week so I am really paying attention to all the info in your journals.  Thanks!!!!!!<br />
Sincerely, Bette</p>
