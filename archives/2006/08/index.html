<h2>August 31, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a000082">New Brunswick 2006  to PEI</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 234px; HEIGHT: 274px" height="240" alt="DSC_1465_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1465_edited_small.jpg" width="159" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Although we have been&nbsp;to the east coast&nbsp;a number of times, we have never visited the Acadian Peninsula, so from Campbellton we followed the Baie des Chaleurs to Caraquet.&nbsp; On the way we stayed at Jacquet River where once again we were dazzled by the sunset over the water.</p>
<p>The campground was run by the municipality and was very nicely set up.&nbsp; They only charged $1.00 for a load of wash (cold water) and the drying was free.&nbsp; We often pay $1.50 to $2.00 per load for each.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p>Caraquet was established in 1758 as Capital de l&rsquo;Acadie and is the oldest French settlement in <img height="213" alt="DSC_1468_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1468_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />northern New Brunswick.&nbsp; It is home to a huge fishing fleet and also outside the town is Village Historique Acadien which interprets the lives of the Acadians from 1770 through 1939.&nbsp; Interpreters in period costumes bring it to life.&nbsp; We had lunch there, eating soup made from ingredients grown in the village (every house had a garden) and eating bread baked by women&nbsp;from the&nbsp;houses in the village.&nbsp; Most of the buildings are authentic Acadian structures, transported to the site and restored.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC_1477_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1477_edited_small1.jpg" width="143" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We&nbsp;drove to the very tip of Miscou Island.&nbsp; We could see the Gaspe Peninsula to the north west but looking to the east into the Gulf there was no land to be seen.&nbsp; The lighthouse at the tip of the island, is the original octagonal tower that&nbsp;was erected in 1856, is made of wood and is still in operation as a&nbsp;manned light.&nbsp;&nbsp; Miscou Island is very flat and the province is&nbsp;building a new ecological boardwalk that circles a pond as it goes out into the plains of the island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get to Miscou Island we passed through Shippagan a busy commercial fishing centre.&nbsp; The fishing boats lined up out of the water looked like some kind of colourful navy.&nbsp; We presume they are waiting for the&nbsp;season to begin again.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 525px; HEIGHT: 118px" height="159" alt="DSC_1475_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1475_edited_small2.jpg" width="640" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also around the Shippagan area are massive peat bogs that are commercially harvested.&nbsp; We tried, but because of how flat they are, the pictures didn&rsquo;t show anything.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_1531" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1531_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />The Acadian houses are very colourful and the red, white and blue flag with the gold star in the upper left corner is everywhere.&nbsp; French, as well as English,&nbsp;is spoken&nbsp;throughout this&nbsp;region.&nbsp;&nbsp; How truly wonderful to be so bilingual.&nbsp;The people of the area slip between the two languages apparently without even thinking about it.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p>We only had a&nbsp;couple days in the area and then carried on toward PEI through towns with such wonderful names as Miramichi, Richibucto, Bouctouce and Shediac.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be in touch from the other side of the Confederation Bridge.</p>

<h2>August 30, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a000081">Quebec 2006 - The Gaspe Peninsula</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 316px; HEIGHT: 208px" height="213" alt="Gaspe - the hills" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gaspe_20_2D_20the_20hills_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 312px; HEIGHT: 209px" height="213" alt="Gaspe - Coast Guard Lighthouse" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gaspe_20_2D_20Coast_20Guard_20Lighthouse_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>On Tuesday, August 22 right around&nbsp;Madeleine-Centre&nbsp;we made the turn from travelling north east to south east.&nbsp; The St. Lawrence is still a river, but thinks it&rsquo;s and ocean, it&rsquo;s so huge.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather has been fine and the air is so clear &ndash; sunny days but chilly nights (actually quite cold).&nbsp; Our view of the hills and the ocean is constant with Coast Guard stations and lighthouses on headlands&nbsp;and small villages tucked into the shore.</p>
<p>As we continued to the end of the Gaspe peninsula we&nbsp;passed through&nbsp;Cap-des-Rosiers, which&nbsp;for sailors is the demarcation point between the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The road goes right through Forillon National Park, at the very tip of the peninsula.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="180" alt="Village on the south shore" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Village_20on_20the_20south_20shore_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Of interest to our RVing friends &ndash;&nbsp;this last part of the road has been quite challenging.&nbsp; We have had numerous grades of 10 to 14% and one quite long one of 18%.&nbsp; On that one, we could smell the brakes by the time we reached the bottom.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p>We spent the night of the 23rd in the town of Gaspe and&nbsp;with a population of 15,000 it is the major community for this part of the province.&nbsp; It has a huge natural harbour and when Jacques Cartier sailed into it in 1534&nbsp;he erected a cross claiming Canada for France.</p>
<p><img height="160" alt="Perce - first view" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Perce_20_2D_20first_20view_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>About 70 km further, as you come over a hill and drive around one more bend, there it is Perce rock,&nbsp;one of the most recognizable natural attractions in the country.&nbsp; We have seen it a couple of times before but it is&nbsp;still an amazing sight.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We stayed at a campground&nbsp;right in the&nbsp;village of Perce and walked from there to the downtown area and out to the rock.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>The tide was low the following morning so we went as far as possible without getting wet.&nbsp; At times the tide has a big enough swing that you can walk on dry land right to the rock, but not the day we were there.&nbsp;It is huge! The limestone rock is&nbsp;1,545 feet long by 288 feet high and was formed about 375 million years ago.<img height="213" alt="Perce at low tide" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Perce_20at_20low_20tide_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 301px; HEIGHT: 212px" height="240" alt="Perce from the water" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Perce_20from_20the_20water_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parc national de l&rsquo;Ile-Bonaventure is an island about 2 miles off the coast and is recognized as the most significant Northern Gannet colony in North America.&nbsp; More than 110 thousand Gannets and other rare species nest on the island every year.&nbsp; It is a now a protected area with clearly marked walking trails.&nbsp; We took a&nbsp;boat tour out around&nbsp;Perce rock and then were&nbsp;dropped off at the island.&nbsp; The drop off point is&nbsp;on the opposite side&nbsp;from where the Gannet colony&nbsp;is and the shortest trail is 2.8 km directly across the island.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Gannet chick with adult" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gannet_20chick_20with_20adult_small.jpg" width="227" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 347px; HEIGHT: 240px" height="213" alt="Gannet colony" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Gannet_20colony_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="245" alt="Pair of Gannets" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Pair_20of_20Gannets_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The noise of thousands of these big birds &ndash; the wingspan is about 6 ft. and the body length about 3 ft. &ndash; is almost overpowering.&nbsp; There are always birds taking off or landing as they dive for fish from up to 100 ft above the surface of the ocean.&nbsp; They pair for life and return to the same spot every year to make their nest.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine how they can possibly find it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The trail leads right to the colony and they can be viewed from a few feet away.&nbsp;&nbsp; We took a different trail (3.5 km) back that took us past some of the abandoned houses that once belonged to fishermen on the island.&nbsp;&nbsp; The province is gradually restoring some of these buildings.</p>
<p>We left Perce on Saturday Aug. 26 and headed along the north shore of the Baie des Chaleurs.&nbsp; Once again we are impressed by the care and colours of the homes.&nbsp; Our impression of the Gaspesie Tourist Region is one of quality and beauty.(They could use some work on the&nbsp;road surfaces, though).&nbsp; It has taken us 10 days to travel about 1,850 km and we have enjoyed it all.</p>
<p>We are on the way to Campbellton, New Brunswick and will write from there.</p>

<h2>August 26, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a000079">Quebec 2006 - The St. Lawrence River</h3>

<p>We left southern Ontario&nbsp;in the first part of the afternoon on Wed. August 16th and&nbsp;spent our first night&nbsp;at Long Sault just west of Cornwall at a beautiful campground in the Parks of the St. Lawrence.&nbsp; The next day we crossed the St. Lawrence river west of Montreal and stayed near the town of Delsen so that Ross could visit the newly renovated and expanded&nbsp; Exporail which was formerly known as the Canadian Railway Museum.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="Quebec2" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Quebec2_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We stayed on the south shore which seems to be much flatter than the north as we were soon able to see large hills showing up across the water.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We stayed&nbsp;in Levis, which is connected to Quebec City by two bridges and ferries.&nbsp; The view of the Chateau Frontenac from the heights of Levis is outstanding.&nbsp; On Saturday, we visited nearby farms where we stocked up on local strawberries, corn, blueberries, tomatoes and beans.&nbsp; We also went to a local cheese shop and got curd and pepper goat cheese.&nbsp; I am becoming quite adept at fitting everything into my&nbsp;8 cu. ft. refrigerator.<br clear="left">
<p>Sunday, the 20th, we headed northwest following the river.&nbsp; It is narr<img height="194" alt="Quebec Farms" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Quebec_20Farms_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />ow at Quebec, then splits around Ile d&rsquo;Orleans and widens&nbsp;as we continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ile d&rsquo;Orleans&nbsp;can be seen quite easily, with its wonderful farms sloping gently to the water.&nbsp; As we travel the south shore we are impressed by the quality of the land and the farms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are following Hwy 132, which we picked up when we crossed into Quebec and we will follow it all the way around the Gaspe.&nbsp; It is the local highway and in general is the road closest to the river.&nbsp; It has a variety of surfaces and they range from excellent to terrible.&nbsp; We have a new shock absorbing hitch that seems to be working.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t feel the back and forth jerking of the trailer as much as before so it makes for a better ride in the truck.&nbsp; However, it does seem to shake the contents of the inside of the trailer&nbsp;so I end up with more things on the floor.&nbsp; Guess, I&rsquo;ll have to batten down the hatches better.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="Quebec House" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Quebec_20House_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Kamouraska is a small town about half way between Quebec City and Riviere-du-Loup and has to be one of the prettiest towns in the province.&nbsp; We have been very impressed by the wonderful stone houses with their flowers and impeccable landscaping.&nbsp; In fact, the whole quality of care as we travel this highway is impressive. This house is very typical of what we have seen&nbsp;and note the swoop to the roof at the eaves.&nbsp; I guess the only thing that is missing&nbsp;is a&nbsp;red roof that&nbsp;is so typical in this province.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="IMG_3803_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3803_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_3812_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3812_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>At Trois Pistoles we parked right on the shore of the St. Lawrence.&nbsp; The river is widening now and we are losing the details of the far shore. It is also tidal here and there was a wonderful sunset at low tide.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we went hiking in Parc du Bic &ndash; it&rsquo;s good to get out walking as we sit so long in the truck&nbsp;when we are on the move.</p>
<p>At the campground in Matane we met up with a RV Caravan that had come across the St. Lawrence (which is 62 km wide here)&nbsp;on the ferry from Baie-Comeau.&nbsp; Turns out it was being led by&nbsp;the&nbsp;organizers of&nbsp;the&nbsp;&ldquo; Safe RV&rsquo;ing&rdquo; caravan that we participated in, in the spring of 2004.&nbsp; We spent the evening with one of the couples that had also been on that caravan.&nbsp; What a great chance meeting!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 171px; HEIGHT: 253px" height="240" alt="Windmills" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Windmills_small.jpg" width="159" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 381px; HEIGHT: 256px" height="207" alt="Lighthouse and sea wall" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Lighthouse_20and_20sea_20wall_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The next day we took the tour of a &ldquo;windmill farm&rdquo; and now are even more impressed with the size and intricate simplicity of this energy source.&nbsp; The mountains now&nbsp;come right down to the water and the new road is built for miles and miles right beside it and is protected by huge sea walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are now headed right out to the end of Gaspe and I&rsquo;ll continue the journal from there</p>
<p>Till then</p>

<h2>August 19, 2006</h2>


<h3 id="a000078">It's been a while!</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re on the road again!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send a journal in a week or so to cover the first part of our trip which will eventually take us to the Maritime Provinces.&nbsp; We will not have time this trip to go to Newfoundland as we will be back home to Cambridge for&nbsp;early October.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="275" alt="With lego_edited" hspace="8" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/With_20lego_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Mandi, Quincy and Ricardo are once again coming home for the Thanksgiving&nbsp;holiday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe but&nbsp;Ricardo will be a little over a year old when we next see him.&nbsp; Time sure does fly!&nbsp; This is a picture of Ricky at Easter.&nbsp; We think he is wonderful, but then perhaps we are a little prejudiced.</p>
<p>Mandi expects that he will be walking by the time they get here as he crawls everywhere and walks along the furniture whenever possible.</p>
<p><br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_3707_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3707_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We have had a good summer.&nbsp; We stayed at Green Acre Park in Waterloo for the month of April and then transfered to a quite new park, Flamboro Valley Camping Resort, just&nbsp;west of Hwy 6 on Hwy 97 east of Cambridge.&nbsp; The folks, Doug &amp; Irene, John &amp; Margaret,&nbsp;were great and we became quite involved with activities in the park.&nbsp; This was only the 3rd full season for the park and&nbsp;they are continuing to expand quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s on my recommended parks list.&nbsp; I also want to recommend our neighbors, Jim &amp; Debbie as well as Mickey across the way.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;the&nbsp;campground&nbsp;is&nbsp;out in the country we had some wonderful sunsets and cloud formations.&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as being a very good park, it was also only 20 minutes from Barnaby and Michelle&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>We have been busy.&nbsp; We did a lot of landscaping at Barn &amp; Shell&rsquo;s as they decided that the front yard was too overgrown for their liking.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been professionally landscaped when the house was new, 14 or so years ago, but as&nbsp;everyone knows, trees, shrubs etc do keep on growing.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still more to do next year but they&nbsp;seem happy with our work&nbsp;(and so are we).</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC00731 (2)" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC00731_20_282_29_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />I&nbsp;really missed painting with my Wed. group in Toronto so started looking for other artists in the area of the park.&nbsp; I found a group in Milton that paints Wednesday during the day and&nbsp;joined them.&nbsp; What a pleasure to get back to the paintbrush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to wait to leave on our trip until the middle of August so that I could be in Art Naturally, a juried show that is held annually&nbsp;in the gardens of&nbsp;the Guild&nbsp;Inn in Toronto.&nbsp; As you can see, the setting is wonderful, the weather was exceptional and to top it all off &ndash;&nbsp;I sold 6 paintings!&nbsp; A very successful show!&nbsp; I expect that I will find wonderful vistas as&nbsp;we travel east and should have many new paintings for the next show.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>One day, earlier in the summer, we played tourist in the area.&nbsp; We&nbsp;started the day&nbsp;by going to the St. Jacob&rsquo;s <img height="213" alt="DSC_1164_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_1164_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />Farmers Market.&nbsp; If you are ever in the area, make sure that you visit it as there is something there for everyone.&nbsp; In particular are the baked goods and preserves brought in by the Mennonite women &ndash;&nbsp;and of course there is the produce!&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued north to Elmira and from there we followed the back roads through the county, looking at the wonderful Mennonite farms, the Conestoga River and dam and, after a stop in St. Jacob&rsquo;s for ice cream, the West Montrose covered bridge.&nbsp; This is the last covered bridge left in Ontario and has been kept in wonderful condition, considering that the road still goes right&nbsp;through it.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>We will be sorry to be away in September as we will miss being there to&nbsp;support Michelle in her&nbsp;fourth year of walking in the Weekend to End Breast Cancer.&nbsp; As many of you know, in 2003 I lost my youngest sister Faye, to breast cancer.&nbsp; Michelle and Barnaby have&nbsp;concentrated their energies&nbsp;to this battle.&nbsp; Over the past&nbsp;3 years Michelle has walked and Barnaby has &ldquo;crewed&rdquo; &nbsp;in Toronto and they have worked as &ldquo;crew&rdquo; for the walks in Calgary, Winnipeg and Ottawa and London, England.&nbsp; Michelle will be walking 60 km over two days with about 4,500 others.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be thinking of her the weekend of September 9 &amp; 10.&nbsp; If any of you would like to help sponsor her&nbsp;(each walker must raise a minimum of $2,000 to be allowed to walk) please&nbsp;go to her web site link <a href="http://endcancer.jeansfamily.ca">http://endcancer.jeansfamily.ca</a> and follow the instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we are off again.&nbsp; As I write this journal, I am sitting on the banks of the St. Lawrence River, looking at the Chateau Frontenac across the river.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s cloudy, so I don&rsquo;t know how the pictures will turn out, but I&rsquo;ll get back to you again in a few days to bring you up to date.</p>
