<h3 id="a000177">Bryce Canyon and the Grand Staircase-Escalente</h3>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><br />
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="IMG_8572_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8572_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />Bryce (named after a Mormon cattle rancher who settled in the area around 1875), is very special because it is the only national park with its type of hoodoo rock formations in the United States. Bryce, established in 1928, is one of the smallest (only 36,000 acres) parks we visited but it is absolutely a one-of-a-kind experience. </p><br />
<p>The featured vista from the rim is called the Amphitheater, a bowl containing thousands of pinnacles of multi-coloured rock, each a different size and shape.</p><br />
<p><br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="168" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/168_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>Our first day we did the walk from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point and up to a towering lookout over the Amphitheater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is surprising how long it takes to walk only a couple of miles, because of the number of times you stop to photograph the changing vistas and say &ldquo;Ah -Wow-Look at that-spectacular&rdquo; etc, etc. <br />
<p><br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_8608_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8608_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>From this rim you can see about 90 to 125 miles, including the Aquarius Plateau, at an elevation over 10,000 feet, the highest plateau in the U.S. <br />
<p><br clear="right">Our second day we decided to hike down into the canyon and selected the Queen&rsquo;s Garden Trail because it has the fewest sharp edges and drop-offs which as you have heard, are my (Ross&rsquo;s) least favourite type of landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve already guessed, going down was much easier than coming back up but well worth the effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with the attached pictures it is hard to describe the beauty of the pink, orange, chocolate and white layered spires at Bryce. </p><br />
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_8637_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8637_edited_small.jpg" width="180" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_8633_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8633_edited_small.jpg" width="180" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="338" alt="IMG_8632_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8632_edited_small.jpg" width="450" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_8628_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8628_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="227" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/227_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /></p><br />
<p></p><br />
<p></p><br />
<p><img height="240" alt="212_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/212_edited_small1.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />On day 3 we completed the drive to Rainbow Point and return &ndash; called the Rim Road as it curls along the very rim of the canyon..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are numerous pull-outs to view the seemingly endless array of outstanding rock formations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although only 17 miles, it took more than 4 hours to get back to the Visitor Centre. <img height="317" alt="IMG_8617_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8617_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>When we were at Bryce a number of years ago, Bernie had done a painting of &ldquo;The Hunter&rdquo; &ndash; the hoodoo pictured here.&nbsp; Unfortunately, progress, in the guise of a better parking area has taken the artistic viewpoint away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill and Barb, enjoy the painting. It is now definitely a one of a kind.</p><br clear="left"><br />
<p>Bryce Canyon draws about one and a half million visitors a year and the fall is an ideal time to be there &ndash; cooler temperatures and less crowded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During our first visit (in summer) we arrived for sunrise (just under 40F degrees), hiked into the canyon and returned for lunch (just over 100F degrees). In these dessert landscapes, you can freeze and boil in half a day. </p><br />
<p></p><br />
<p><img height="240" alt="244E_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/244E_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />Our last day in this area we drove to Boulder (Utah not Colorado) through Grand Staircase/Escalante, some of the most remote, un-populated and very rugged miles we have travelled. The Grand Staircase is a series of giant geological steps from the south rim of the Grand Canyon to the Aquarius Plateau, already mentioned. Each &lsquo;step&rsquo; or layer is a different colour.</p><br />
<p>It had snowed in the higher plateaus the night before, so there was a different perspective.<br clear="right"></p><img height="240" alt="IMG_8648_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8648_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /> <br />
<p></p></span><br />
<p></p><br />
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Depending on the elevation of the road, we were in either, grey, red or black rock.</span></p><br />
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">In the picture to the left, we were up high.&nbsp; Notice the road on the right hand side and the white in the middle is actually a working ranch.</span></p><br />
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</p><br clear="left"><br />
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><img height="193" alt="IMG_8654_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8654_edited_small1.jpg" width="280" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p><br />
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Sometimes we travelled the absolute razor back of the ridges.</span></p><br />
<p>After a very enjoyable lunch in Boulder, we drive back to the KOA at Cannonville for domestic duties like laundry. </p><br />
<p>This, our second visit to Bryce Canyon, we both agreed had been as good as our memory of the first visit.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s satisfying to revisit and again be impressed.</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;In travel mode again tomorrow, November 6th. </p><br />
<p>We've heard from Jim &amp; Carolyn and it looks like we'll meet them again at the campground in Zion. </p><br />
<p></p><br />
