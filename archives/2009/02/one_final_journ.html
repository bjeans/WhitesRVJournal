<h3>One Final Journey</h3>

<h1 align="center">BERNICE EDITH WHITE</h1>  <h4 align="center">1942 – 2009</h4>  <p><a title="Bernice White" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42228781@N00/3252389464/"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="Bernice White" src="http://static.flickr.com/3485/3252389464_20bd2eea8e.jpg" width="300" height="420" /></a></p>  <p>Some of you have commented that there have not been any additional chapters about our Great North American Road trip. In December, Bernie began to experience severe pain below her left shoulder and around her left rib cage. Just after Christmas, while we were in Mexico, we went to a clinic that determined there was a considerable amount of fluid between the walls of Bernie’s left lung.</p>  <p>To cut a long story short, we decided to come home and Bernie flew to Toronto from Phoenix on January 9, arriving about 6:30 PM. Our son-in-law, Barnaby, took her directly to Cambridge Hospital where she was admitted. A few days later she was transferred to the Firestone Centre for Respiratory Health in Hamilton and on January 16<sup>th</sup> she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which had already begun to spread.</p>  <p>On the following Monday they did a bone scan which indicated the cancer had penetrated to most bone groups and that she had Stage 4 cancer for which there was no treatment. They could only make her comfortable and control the pain, which they did.</p>  <p>Her condition worsened rapidly as the cancer spread and multiplied throughout her body. This past Sunday they began the final drug treatment, to relieve pain and reduce stress and our daughters, sons-in-law, grandsons and I, along with many friends, all came to say goodbye.</p>  <p>At about 7:45pm on Monday, February 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2009 she took her last breaths and departed for the Great RV Rally in Heaven. Although very sad and tearful, we were relieved that her ordeal was over – only 17 days after the first diagnosis.</p>  <p>When I heard the verdict on January 16<sup>th</sup>, I decided that I could never RV again, without my navigator. But I have changed my mind. It is now my intention to continue, at least part-time, later this year. I will tell Bernie my itinerary and describe the sights along the way. I believe she will watch over me, as she has always done, and guide me as we travel together in spirit.</p>  <p>At the moment I am a bit of train wreck, but friends and family who have been through this tell me that the first hundred years are the toughest…after that it gets easier. So stay tuned, there are still a couple of chapters to be written about our final destinations in 2008, but you’ll have to put up with me. There may be some tears on the pages.</p>  <p>Bernie, my love and my life for 44 years is gone,    <br />but as our journal says, </p>  <p>“It’s not the destination…it’s the journey”.</p>  <p>Visitation and Memorial Service – <a href="http://www.humphreymiles.com/home.html" target="_blank">Humphrey Funeral Home</a>    <br />Visitation: Thursday, February 5<sup>th</sup> from 2-4pm and 7-9pm    <br />Memorial Service: Friday, February 6<sup>th</sup> at 11am    <br />Luncheon to follow</p>

<p>Dear Ross,<br />
I am so sorry to hear about Bernie.  I am happy that you two got the chance to have this amazing adventure together.  I lost my husband two years ago, and this will be a difficult time for you.  It does get easier, and wonderful memories really get you through the rough patches.  God Bless,  Kathleen</p>

<p>Ross,</p>

<p>We wish to extend our heartfelt sympathy to you and your family.  Jerry and I parked next to you in Naco AZ just about a year ago in our Hitchhiker.  We did Fish and Chips and then visited after.  Bernie was so vibrant and warm.  We have so enjoyed your website and story of all your travels.  </p>

<p>Hi Ross - My sincere condolences. I have been enjoying the journals and spoke to Bernice on several occasions in the summer/fall before last, when she did some work for O'Shanter. I have known her for many years through our O'Shanter connection - we provide the laundry machines for some of their buildings. I went to see her paintings at the Guild Inn art show, which I always enjoyed. I will remember her fondly. Take care, Ann</p>

<p>Uncle Ross,</p>

<p>Words can't tell you how sad we are for your loss. I really thought we would have a chance to see Aunt Bernice one more time; to hug her neck and tell her how much she has meant to me and Paul. She made me feel so welcomed in the family and always seemed to take a special interest in us after Faye passed away. We will truly miss her. </p>

<p>Our thoughts and especially our prayers are with you, Shelly & Mandy right now. I can't imagine losing the person I'd spent the last 44 years with or losing my mother. I am so thankful that she did not suffer for long and that she was surrounded by the people she loved the most.</p>

<p>Please know that we would be there for the services in a heartbeat if I wasn't so close to delivering. We will be there in spirit. Again, we are praying for you all, for comfort and peace during this difficult time.</p>

<p>We love you!<br />
Jill, Paul & Jack</p>

<p>As I watched and read all the journals and pictures, I felt it was the most beautiful thing.<br />
Some of the pictures looked like heaven on earth.<br />
It is evident you had made the right choice and enjoying your retired time together in the most beautiful way.  She will be your guardian angel from heaven.  No doubt it will be hard but the love and memories live forever in our hearts.   </p>

<p>As I sit here reading this I am crying. I can't believe that such a bright light is gone! I remember how wonderful she was in art class. She was always so positive and had so many helpful tips for my paintings. Art class is tonight so I know we will talk about Bernice and the joy she brought us in class. I know she is still with you (and us) in her own wonderful way.</p>

<p>God bless you!</p>

<p>Dear Ross!<br />
First, let me reintroduce ourselves. Carole and I met you and Bernice in Kino Bay, At Islandia R.V.PK.<br />
and I remember,Bernie suffering a bad Cold.We had common Friends in Ontario, although we now reside in B.C.(Peachland).Bernie told me, that she worked at the same Company, with Barbara Kelly, whose Husband Norm, was my Platoon-chief on the T.F.D. We have been following your Adventures ever since.<br />
Please accept our sincere Condolences,for the Loss you have and are suffering. We know, it will be very hard times for you and admire your spirit in the Decision, to carry on trucking.<br />
Our thoughts and Prayers will be with you.<br />

<p>Ross, I am so sorry for your loss and so amazed at your courage and strength. You are welcome to visit us anytime at the farm. The beautiful painting that Bernice gave us hangs on our wall in the living room and now has even more special meaning. <br />

<p>Dear Ross:</p>

<p>Its very difficult to know what to say.  It seems so trite to offer condolences.  What a wonderful marriage you have had.  I will always remember Bernice on the day you were moving out of your house and getting ready for your RV odyssey.  I grieve for you, Ross.</p>

<p>I continue to read "the last journey" and hope that this, the extension is going well. <br />
Where are you, anyway?? are you well???</p>

<p>I have enrolled in an intensive Acrylic course at the College, and am considering two others, as I carry on with this Acrylic painting journey.</p>

<p>That I should be as blessed in this medium as Bernie will be my goal.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you are enjoying some improved weather and have met some fellow RV folks en route.</p>
