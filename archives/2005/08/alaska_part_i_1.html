<h3>Alaska - Part I</h3>

<p>We crossed into Canada of Wed. July 27th and it was very easy.&nbsp; Took about 2 minutes as there was no line up at all and customs basically waved us through.&nbsp; Our campground was only about 5 km from the border&nbsp;and from there&nbsp;over the next couple of days we&nbsp;toured the White Rock, Langley, Surrey area.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had&nbsp;arranged with&nbsp;the campground&nbsp;to park the trailer in a field while we were on the Alaska cruise.&nbsp; We had planned on going in to Vancouver and staying in a hotel close to the dock on Friday &ndash; but &ndash; when we found out that the hotels in that area were $250 to $300 per night we went to plan B.&nbsp; We stayed at the campground one more night.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC_0004_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0004_edited_small1.jpg" width="159" align="left" vspace="15" border="2" /></p>
<p>That Friday evening, we were entertained when&nbsp;a hot air balloon crew arrived and set up&nbsp;in the field&nbsp;about 100 yards from us.&nbsp; They do charter rides and had 11 people they were taking up.&nbsp; It was most intriging to watch the whole&nbsp;process. They can&rsquo;t control where they go so they have a chase car that follows as best it can to pick up the passengers when it lands.&nbsp; If we had gone downtown to a hotel we would have missed this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;As&nbsp;we were almost due&nbsp;to have an oil change, tire rotation and differential service, we contacted a GM dealer in the city and made arrangements to have it done while we were away.&nbsp; They did the work and then kept the truck for us for the week&nbsp;and even paid for the cab ride to the ship. &nbsp;Had we left the truck at the campground the cab would have been about $90.<br clear="left">We met Barnaby &amp; Michelle, who had our tickets, and then boarded the ship &ndash; Holland America&rsquo;s Zaandam &ndash; about noon on Saturday.&nbsp; Barnaby&rsquo;s parents were also on the cruise, as well as his grandmother, an aunt &amp; uncle&nbsp;from England and great aunt and cousins from Vancouver Island.&nbsp; There were 12 in&nbsp;our group.&nbsp; It was great to have others on the cruise to meet for meals, etc. but we all did our own thing during the day and while on shore. </p>
<p>On boarding, we of course&nbsp;headed directly to the lunch buffet as our luggage and rooms would not be ready until later that afternoon.&nbsp; One thing we learned quickly is that you never go hungry.&nbsp; The food was excellent with lots of choices and at least one restaurant was open at all times. Our dinner seating in the more formal dining room was at 7:45 and we had a window table.&nbsp; The service was wonderful and nothing seemed too much trouble for any staff member.&nbsp; That was true all over the ship, everyone went out of their way to provide you with every service, right down to carrying your tray from the buffet line to a table.</p>
<p>We left the dock in Vancouver at 5 PM and sailed up the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the mainland. Sunday we continued up the Inside Passage with signs of civilization becoming less and less.&nbsp; At one point we had a whole school of dolphins playing around the ship.&nbsp; The sea was quite calm although&nbsp;on Sunday morning as we were in Queen Charlotte Sound away from land there was quite a roll.&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner had we noticed the rolling, than we could feel the stabilizers employed and the ship settled right down again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="213" alt="DSC_0039_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0039_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="5" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0066_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0066_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="5" border="2" /></p>
<p>We were awakened on Monday morning by the speaker in our room&nbsp;announcing that we had arrived in Tracy Arm.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a beautiful fjord just south of Juneau.&nbsp; We saw our first iceburgs &ndash; not the huge ones that you see in pictures, but small ones floating everywhere.&nbsp; They were the most beautiful blue and when the sun shone through them were almost irridescent.&nbsp; The water is also blue green which is a result of the glacial silt that is carried by the streams from the glaciers.&nbsp; As we left Tracy Arm we went through a fog bank so thick that you couldn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="213" alt="DSC_0080_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0080_edited_small2.jpg" width="320" vspace="3" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0083_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0083_edited_small3.jpg" width="320" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>In the afternoon we docked in Juneau, the state capital of Alaska.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no roads from the outside into Juneau so it can only be reached by sea or air.&nbsp; There were a number of tours that could be taken from there and Barn &amp; Shell went out to&nbsp;the Mendenhall Glacier.&nbsp; We stayed in town and took a tour of the State Capital building as well as wandering around the shopping area.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t buy much as we have no&nbsp;place to keep it, but we enjoy looking.&nbsp; The ship left Juneau at 11:00 pm but we had come back about 8:00 pm for dinner.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0051" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0051_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Tuesday when we woke we were dockside in Skagway.&nbsp; At noon we took the train, the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route Railroad for a half day&nbsp;narrated ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail line was built in 1898 to carry supplies and people (who could afford it)&nbsp;to the Klondike gold rush.&nbsp; The picture at the left is&nbsp;part of the trail that the miners used and is so narrow that you couldn&rsquo;t meet except at certain points.&nbsp; Each miner had to have with him enough supplies to last for a year (about&nbsp;2000 lbs) before the Mounties would let him cross into the Yukon.&nbsp;&nbsp;It took&nbsp; them numerous trips up this trail and many pack animals and people didn&rsquo;t make it.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0049_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0049_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="3" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0031_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0031_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>The train tracks are&nbsp;narrow gauge, which means the rails are 3 feet apart.&nbsp; A regular track is&nbsp;4 ft 8 1/2 inches.&nbsp; By using the narrow gauge, the track bed only needed to be 10 feet wide instead of 15 feet.&nbsp; That was very important when&nbsp;they were building on the side of a mountain.&nbsp; The White Pass summit is 2,865 ft and is about 20 miles from Skagway which is at sea level.&nbsp; The scenery is beautiful with great mountain vistas.&nbsp; We saw mountain sheep in the distance and a bear beside the tracks.&nbsp; All in all a wonderful 4 hours.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tonight we set sail for Glacier Bay and will be there when we wake in the morning.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll tell you about it in the next journal report.</p>
