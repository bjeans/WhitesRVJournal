<h3>Alaska - Part II</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 384px; HEIGHT: 250px" height="187" alt="DSC_0090_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0090_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 360px; HEIGHT: 249px" height="213" alt="DSC_0116_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0116_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>As we were arriving in Glacier Bay National Park, we travelled through quite thick fog which obscured the land that we were passing.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we arrived at Margerie Glacier there was some clearing although the overcast remained.&nbsp; The Park Wardens told us that because of the overcast, the blue of the glacier would show much more.&nbsp; In the sun it is whiter.&nbsp; We were very fortunate as the glacier calved (chunks broke away) 6 times during the 1 1/2 hours we were close to her.&nbsp; In the picture above&nbsp;and the one below,&nbsp;the white breaking&nbsp;the surface of the water is the splash from one of the chunks that broke off.&nbsp; This wall of ice is about 250 feet high above the water and about the same under the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 379px; HEIGHT: 267px" height="213" alt="DSC_0132_edited" hspace="6" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0132_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 377px; HEIGHT: 270px" height="213" alt="DSC_0152_edited" hspace="6" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0152_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="245" alt="DSC_0011_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0011_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="6" border="2" />The glaciers in the mountains feed hundreds of streams and rivers that wind their way down the sides and into the bay.&nbsp; We spent the whole day in Glacier Bay and saw 5 or 6 glaciers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the way out of Glacier Bay we were treated to a visit of&nbsp;a pod of whales.&nbsp; We watched them blow, surface and dive&nbsp;for probably 20 minutes.&nbsp; One of them surfaced about 50 feet from the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Captain immediately threw on the bow thrusters to move away from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;When whales are spotted the ships are to stay a specified distance from them.&nbsp; Of course the captain has no control over where the whales&nbsp;swim so sometimes they do get very close.&nbsp; This is where we now start to head south toward Vancouver.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The next day, Thursday, we arrived in Ketchican&nbsp;shortly after lunch.&nbsp; Ross says that he will never complain again about how hard it is to park the RV after he watched the docking of this ship.</p>
<p><img height="310" alt="DSC_0017_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0017_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />&nbsp;We walked around town a bit, stopping and talking to a&nbsp;few fishermen on the short bridge.&nbsp; The salmon were running and there were probably 25 to 30 people fishing off the bridge.&nbsp; We watched the salmon trying to navigate the rapids. A little further up the river, there is a fish ladder to help them past the falls.&nbsp; Apparently, the addition of these fish ladders on various streams and rivers has greatly increased the success rate and thus the overall salmon population.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went to the &ldquo;Great Lumberjack Show&rdquo; which was a lot of fun.&nbsp; There were some great displays of skill &ndash; wood chopping, log rolling, tree climbing.&nbsp; The picture on the left shows one of the lumberjacks chopping down a stump (tree) while standing on a plank about 6 or 8 feet above the ground.&nbsp; The real loggers did this to get above the large root area and stump at ground level.<br clear="left"><img height="213" alt="DSC_0024_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0024_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" /></p>
<p>After the show, we walked up Creek Street, which was the red light district of Ketchican and is all built on pylons over the creek.&nbsp; The houses are original and most have moss growing on them.&nbsp; The part of Alaska that we have visited is considered temperate rain forest and Ketchican can get&nbsp;100 inches of rain a year but very little snow.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were told that if it wasn&rsquo;t raining when we got off the ship it would be by the time we returned.&nbsp; They were right.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0036_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0036_edited_small2.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" /></p>
<p>Friday was a sailing day as we headed back down through Queen Charlotte Sound and the Strait of Georgia.&nbsp; There were wonderful vistas of the B.C. mainland mountains to the east and wooded mountains of the north of Vancouver Island.&nbsp; We started seeing civilization before it got dark and as we sat at dinner that night there were lights on a continuing basis.&nbsp; When we awakened on Saturday morning we were just arriving in Vancouver to dock.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a 10 AM disembarkation time as we did not have flights to catch etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone with a tight connection schedule got off first. As&nbsp;the cruise&nbsp;had been in the US there were even arrangements for US citizens to go &ldquo;in bond&rdquo; to the airport so that they did not have to go through first Canada &amp; then US customs.</p>
<p>We said our goodbyes to Barn and Shell and the rest of the gang, took a cab to the dealership to pick up our truck and head back to the campground to see how the trailer had fared in our absence&nbsp; &ndash; and to do laundry.</p>
<p>Sunday, Aug 7th we are heading to Vancouver Island</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>

<p>I have been to Ketchican AL and it is a neat little town.  I only got there once.<br />
Look forward to any pics you have of my old stomping ground Victoria.<br />
