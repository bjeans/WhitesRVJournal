<h2>August 10, 2005</h2>

<h3>Nothern Oregon</h3>

<p>5 days; 5,612&nbsp;registered RVs holding&nbsp;about 12,000 people;&nbsp;another1,000 daily admissions;&nbsp;over 1,000 RVs on display and about 500 indoor exhibitors<img style="WIDTH: 425px; HEIGHT: 290px" height="259" alt="IMG_2890" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2890_small.jpg" width="345" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />; the Redmond School Board buses hired to shuttle registrants from the RV parking areas; headliner entertainment in the evening&nbsp;&ndash; Debbie Reynolds, Pam Tillis, Ronny Milsap; about 100 different seminars on everything from &ldquo;Fundamentals of Trailer Supension Systems and Brakes&rdquo; to &ldquo;99 days to Panama&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Redmond, Oregon&nbsp;RV rally was quite a spectacle.</p>
<p>We were in parking area &ldquo;H&rdquo; which was really a farm field, complete with 8&rdquo; grain stubble and dust and was about 4 miles from the fairgrounds where the activities were.&nbsp; There were about 700 RVs where we were and the organization getting everyone in and later out was outstanding.&nbsp; In fact, we were very impressed with the efficiency and organization of the whole rally.&nbsp; Bernie took this picture standing on the roof of our trailer.</p>
<p>We arrived on Sunday July 10th, around noon&nbsp;and left Friday morning.&nbsp; This was the test for our solar system as we had no hookups for the 5 days.&nbsp; It worked wonderfully and we were able to have all the comforts just as if we had been plugged in.</p>
<p>By Thursday evening we were exhausted, as we usually went for&nbsp;the morning seminar at 8:30 and didn&rsquo;t come back until after the evening entertainment.&nbsp; It was well worth the time spent as we learned so much and saw and heard so many new ideas both in the seminars and at the exhibits.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know if we will go to next years rally &ndash; it&rsquo;s in Daytona, FL in April &ndash; but we definately will go to another at some point.</p>
<p><img height="246" alt="IMG_2897" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2897_small.jpg" width="328" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />After we left the rally we went back south of Bend to the High Desert Museum.&nbsp; It is a natural museum set outside among the trees as well as some wonderful indoor displays.&nbsp; The rangers brought a&nbsp;bobcat&nbsp;out to the one of the outdoor displays and gave a short talk about it as well as answering questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent the whole day at the museum. We spent the night at the WalMart parking lot in Redmond as all the campgrounds were full because the rally was just over.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>We are now heading north so that we will be in Vancouver on July 30th as we have reservations to leave on a 7 day cruise to Alaska.&nbsp; But there is much to see on the way.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 399px; HEIGHT: 322px" height="240" alt="IMG_2927_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2927_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="textBottom" vspace="5" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 226px; HEIGHT: 318px" height="240" alt="IMG_2940_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2940_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="textBottom" vspace="5" border="2" /></p>
<p>These pictures were taken in the Columbia Gorge.&nbsp; The Columbia River at this point is the border between Oregon and Washington.&nbsp; Some of the waterfalls are spectacular.&nbsp; This one is Multnomoh Falls and is over 600 feet high.&nbsp; You can see a foot&nbsp;bridge part way up that crosses over the water.&nbsp; The view of the falls from&nbsp;the bridge&nbsp;is quite impressive but&nbsp;is too close to get a good overall picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are heading now to Washington.&nbsp; This is the final state in the contiguous United States that we have yet to visit.&nbsp; Most of the others we visited with our daughters when they were teenagers.</p>
