<h3>Southern Oregon</h3>

<p>As we headed to southern Oregon on July 1st, we passed huge herds of cattle &ndash; mostly black angus.&nbsp; The grass is very lush&nbsp;and irrigation of the grazing land is common.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the flat valleys we started up again into the hills following I-5 over Siskiyou Pass, through Ashland and Medford to Rogue River,&nbsp;a popular summer destination.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0081_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0081_edited_small2.jpg" width="320" vspace="5" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0076_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0076_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="5" border="2" /><br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;Since this&nbsp;was the&nbsp;4th of July weekend,&nbsp;we had made reservations at a campground to be sure&nbsp;we had a spot.&nbsp; The campground was right on the Rogue River and had tables and chairs on the dock.&nbsp; A very nice setup.&nbsp; There were only 25 sites and&nbsp;they were an extremely friendly group, coming over and introducing themselves when we had set out our chairs.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="316" alt="DSC_0092_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0092_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />On Saturday, having been fortified with fudge and raspberries at the Grant&rsquo;s Pass farmer&rsquo;s market,&nbsp;we drove out further into the countryside and stopped at Wilderness Images.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a conservation organization that rehabilitates&nbsp;wild animals that have been injured or abandoned and reintroduces them back into the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1 1/2 hour tour with a guide explained what they do and showed some of the animals that they have.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ones you see can not be reintroduced into the wild due to a number of reasons.&nbsp; They may have an injury or they may have become imprinted&nbsp;by humans and would not survive.&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw 2 grizzilies (finally)&nbsp;(brother and sister), mountain lions, black bears, wolves, otters&nbsp;and up close, a bald&nbsp;eagle, a golden eagle, a turkey buzzard and a great horned owl.&nbsp;&nbsp;The animals&nbsp;that are going to be reintroduced have minimal human contact and are nowhere near the public areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a private facility and survives on donations and private sponsors.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_2837_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2837_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" /></p>
<p>Monday, July 4th was not only the U.S. Independence day, it was also our 41st wedding anniversary.&nbsp; We celebrated by going on&nbsp;a Rogue River Hellsgate Canyon Jetboat&nbsp;trip.&nbsp; We went 18 miles up the river into this beautiful lava canyon, had a wonderful lunch and returned to the campground to&nbsp;celebrate the 4th with a potluck supper on the river.&nbsp; All we seemed to do that day was eat!&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbours on the river have a competition each year to see who puts on the best fireworks show, so we had front row seats.</p>
<p>We are gradually heading to Redmond to the RV Rally that is being held there.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be checking in next&nbsp;Sunday, July 10th&nbsp;.&nbsp; On the way we stayed at Collier State Park which is on the east side of the Cascade Mountains &ndash; so &ndash; back over another mountain pass.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0139" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0139_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />With our base at the park, north of&nbsp; Klamath Falls, we toured Crater Lake.&nbsp; The lake was formed when ancient Mount Mazama erupted and collapsed into itself 7,700 years ago.&nbsp; It is 1,943 feet deep (deepest in United States) and is filled with rain and melted snow and there is no inlet or outlet.&nbsp; The colour is the most startling blue and the lake, about five miles wide, is ringed with 2,000 foot cliffs.&nbsp; One of the Islands (it&rsquo;s there in the picture) is called Phantom Ship and was formed by subsequent eruptions&nbsp;that have now eroded into a ship shape.<br clear="left"></p>
