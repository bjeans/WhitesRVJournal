<h3>Montana</h3>

<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0033_edited" hspace="8" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0033_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="8" border="2" />Tuesday morning, May 31th, we headed west on the Interstate into Montana in the pouring rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;From Billings Montana&nbsp;the next&nbsp;day we went to the Little Bighorn Battlefield Historic Site, where the battle between the US 7th Cavalry (General Custer)&nbsp;and the Sioux, Lacota and Cheyenne Indians took place in 1876.&nbsp; The tour provided by&nbsp;a&nbsp;Crow Indian guide&nbsp;at the site was very interesting and informative&nbsp;as it was presented from the perspective of the Indian.&nbsp; While we were there the most spectacular storm arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in the visitor&rsquo;s centre attending a presentation by a park ranger and watched its progress across the valley with wild winds, heavy rain and hail.&nbsp; &nbsp;Initially we could see about 18 miles and when it finally&nbsp;arrived we could see only a few hundred yards.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the camera was in the truck so no pictures.&nbsp; After it passed, we went back up the trail and took some pictures of the hail that had come down.&nbsp; It looked like it had snowed.</p>
<p>We had&nbsp;considered going to Yellowstone over the Beartooth Pass, but in the 10 days before there had been 12 landslides covering the road.&nbsp; The state does not expect it to be open&nbsp; all this summer and will take about 20 million dollars&nbsp;to repair.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how much rain they have had this spring but everyone is still saying that it is not enough as they have had a 5 to 7 year drought.</p>
<p>From Billings on Thursday we went west and then south at Livingston through Paradise Valley.&nbsp; It is a wonderful green and fertile valley between two mountain ranges.&nbsp; For the next couple of&nbsp;nights we stayed in Gardiner at the north entrance of Yellowstone Park and then stayed for two nights in one of the&nbsp;park campgrounds.</p>
<p>Yellowstone is&nbsp;an amazing place.&nbsp; The north is mountains, wide valleys and sweeping hills; south is lodge pole pine, geysers, hot springs and mud pots and the center is a beautiful deep canyon and more hot springs.&nbsp; Then there are waterfalls seemingly whereever you look.&nbsp; We actually had sun on Saturday afternoon and Sunday.</p>

<p>There are animals everywhere; some singly some in herds &ndash; buffalo, elk, mule deer, mountain sheep, bears, a coyote and a bald eagle.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0107" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0107_small.jpg" width="320" align="textBottom" vspace="10" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0123" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0123_small.jpg" width="320" align="textBottom" vspace="10" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 295px; HEIGHT: 213px" height="229" alt="DSC_0087_edited" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0087_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="textBottom" vspace="10" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 296px; HEIGHT: 214px" height="238" alt="DSC_0102_edited" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0102_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="textBottom" vspace="10" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We left Yellowstone Monday morning June 6th.&nbsp; Again it was raining and cold and we decided to only travel just outside the park to West Yellowstone to have a day of rest.&nbsp; We had had a few very busy days in the park as we had hiked&nbsp;numerous trails to see the various points of interest.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At this point we&nbsp;were extremely tired of the rain and cold.&nbsp; Tuesday morning we woke up to a snow storm and had to scrape snow off the steps when we went outside.&nbsp; That confirmed our inclination.&nbsp; We decided to head into southern Idaho and the Snake River&nbsp;Plain to try to find some warmer weather.&nbsp; After that we will probably go further south into northern Nevada as we have never been to that area.&nbsp; The weather channel says that we should find some sun &ndash; we hope so.</p>
