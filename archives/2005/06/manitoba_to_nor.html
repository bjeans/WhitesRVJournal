<h3>Manitoba to North Dakota</h3>

<p>On Friday May 27th we headed west in Manitoba along Highway 2 to Souris.&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="DSC_0198" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0198_small.jpg" width="159" align="left" vspace="10" border="2" /> This town is on the Souris River which&nbsp;flows into the Assiniboine.&nbsp; One of the well-to-do residents in the early 30s built a swinging foot bridge over the river so that he could easily get into the town.&nbsp; It still stands today and at 582 feet is the longest swinging bridge in Canada.&nbsp; The town now keeps it in very good repair and it was used constantly by the residents during our time there.<img height="240" alt="DSC_0206" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0206_small.jpg" width="159" align="right" vspace="10" border="2" /></p>
<p>We headed south&nbsp;into North Dakota to Rugby, the geographical centre of North America, and then west to Minot.&nbsp; On Saturday we went in to Minot so Ross could do some train watching as it is a junction point for the CPR and&nbsp;Burlington Northern Santa Fe.&nbsp; We arrived at the station just as the Amtrak &ldquo; Empire Builder&rdquo; arrived on it&rsquo;s way west.&nbsp; We were surprised at the large number of people that boarded it there.</p>
<p>On Sunday we went south to the Garrison Dam on the Missouri River, which caused the formation of&nbsp;Lake Sakakawea.&nbsp; The lake is named after the young Indian girl who was the guide for the Lewis and Clarke Expedition.&nbsp; This is the 200th anniversary of the Expedition and all along the route there are celebrations, special events and a lot of hoopla.&nbsp; Apparently there has been a drought in the Midwest for the last number of years and some of the states down river are&nbsp;taking legal action to try to force&nbsp;North Dakota to release more water through the dam.&nbsp; The water level in the lake is already about 30 feet below normal.&nbsp; The dam is huge &ndash; it is earthen and is&nbsp;over 2 miles long, 1/2 mile wide at the base, 276 feet high&nbsp;and 60 feet across at the top.&nbsp; The highway runs across the top.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0213" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0213_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="10" border="2" />At this point we are seeing quite different landscape from the prairies of Manitoba.&nbsp; The hills appear as if some giant took shovels full of earth and haphazardly threw them around.&nbsp; They are grassland and there is very little cultivation.</p>
<p>Sunday night outside Bismark ND we had our first experience staying at a Truck Stop overnight.&nbsp; It was behind the building and certainly not the quietest location but all we did was sleep there so we didn&rsquo;t need anything fancy.&nbsp; We have found the 5r to be very soundproof and it proved itself that night.&nbsp; It cost us $10.00 US&nbsp;and we had full hookups (water, electricity, sewer).&nbsp; That is cheap as we are probably averaging around $26.00 Cdn.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It has been raining most of the time we have been on the road and continues to do so.&nbsp; I must admit that we are getting very tired of wet and dull.&nbsp; Also, as you can see, none of our pictures are very bright without the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday we headed out toward the North Dakota Badlands and set up in the town of Medora just outside Theodore Roosevelt National Park.&nbsp; A real western town on the Little Missouri river &ndash; population 100 permanent residents.<img height="213" alt="DSC_0224" hspace="8" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0224_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="8" border="2" />&nbsp; Tuesday we spent touring the&nbsp;Badlands and encountered a buffalo right at the side of the road.&nbsp; There also were a number of very large prairie dog towns with hundreds of burrows and dozens of animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This land is very stark, beautiful and dramatic.&nbsp; Many coloured layers&nbsp;can be seen in the eroded cliffs and ledges but there is also grass that supports wildlife.&nbsp; This was one of Roosevelt&rsquo;s favourite areas and he was instrumental as a conservationist in the formation of this park as well as Yellowstone and others.<img height="218" alt="DSC_0022_edited" hspace="6" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0022_edited_small.jpg" width="300"  vspace="10" border="2" /></p>
<p>On a cliff overlooking Medora is the &ldquo;Chateau de Mores&rdquo; , a&nbsp;&ldquo;hunting cabin&rdquo; built by a French&nbsp;Count.&nbsp; It has 10 bedrooms, 4 room owners suite plus kitchen,&nbsp;pantry, parlor and formal dining room.&nbsp; It has been completely restored even to original wallpaper.&nbsp; His&nbsp;meat packing plant failed and&nbsp;thus the house&nbsp;was used only for about 3 years.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday the 31st, we head out for Montana.&nbsp; Stay tuned</p>
