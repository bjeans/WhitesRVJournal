<p><img style="WIDTH: 367px; HEIGHT: 259px" height="213" alt="IMG_5451" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5451_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Our Thanksgiving this year was very special as we celebrated it with our first grandchild.&nbsp; Ricardo Ross Walker, 8lbs 3oz and&nbsp;21&rdquo; long, arrived safely&nbsp;on September 29, 2005 at about 6 PM.&nbsp; Mother and son both doing well.</p>
<p>Our daughter, Mandi, came&nbsp;back to Canada on September 11<font size="2">th</font>, from her home in the Bahamas so that she could have the baby here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricardo decided to&nbsp;arrive early and his father, Quincy,&nbsp;unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t get air connections fast enough and didn&rsquo;t arrive until about midnight that night.</p>
<p>Our younger daughter and her husband, had moved to a new home in Cambridge the first of July.&nbsp; Mandi and Quincy were fortunately able to stay with them while here in&nbsp;Canada.&nbsp; They went back&nbsp;home to the Bahamas October 20<font size="2">th</font>.&nbsp; How wonderful it was to&nbsp;be able to have this time with our girls and their husbands &ndash;&nbsp;and Ricardo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how such a little bundle can take over your heart!&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we started this adventure on the road, we didn&rsquo;t have any experience and&nbsp;we didn&rsquo;t know how long we would continue.&nbsp; We wanted to see whether in really was for us on not.</p>
<p>We like it.&nbsp; We expect to continue.&nbsp; We have been having fun.&nbsp; But &ndash; the slide on the Jayco trailer was only 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; and Ross is 6&rsquo;3&rdquo;.&nbsp; Needless to say he hit his head on numerous occasions which took the edge off his enjoyment.&nbsp; We decided, if we were going to keep on travelling, we should&nbsp;make a trade&nbsp;for a new one with higher&nbsp;interior space.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0152" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0152_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We have a new trailer &ndash; it is still a 5th wheel, a Hitchhiker II and is 34&rsquo; long (the old one was 32&rsquo;).&nbsp; It has 3 slides &ndash; one for the bedroom and one on each side of the living room (the old one had 2 slides).&nbsp; Most importantly, the slides and bedroom are high enough that Ross can stand up straight without hitting his head.&nbsp; So far we are very happy with it and the extra&nbsp;space is great as it makes our living area about 14&rsquo; wide.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_3233" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3233_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />While home we went to Milton fair,&nbsp;visited friends &amp;&nbsp;office colleagues, Bernie painted, Ross played??? golf (for the first time in 30 years) and&nbsp;we both gave landscaping assistance at Barnaby &amp; Shell&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; We went to dentists, doctors and had our eyes checked.&nbsp; Bernie had surgery (she is fine) and had to take it easy for a number of weeks.&nbsp; We spent time with sisters and sister-in-law and other family.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>And now we are ready to go again.&nbsp; December 7th is D (Departure) date.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll&nbsp;be in touch from the road.</p>
<p>Ross and Bernie</p>

<h2>December 10, 2005</h2>


<h3 id="a000059">Northern Ontario to Home</h3>

<p>It has been a few months since I sent out the last journal and we have been home and are now back on the road.&nbsp; While we were home we had a very busy time and I didn&rsquo;t get the last journal sent out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soooooo &mdash; here is the last of the trip west.&nbsp; Following this we will update you on our time at home and our new journey.<br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 322px; HEIGHT: 175px" height="170" alt="DSC_0123_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0123_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="200" alt="DSC_0125_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0125_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Northern Ontario is wonderful clear lakes and tumbling waterfalls and of course TREES.&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles and miles and miles of trees.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0128" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0128_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Highway 11 in Ontario&nbsp;is one of &nbsp;the longest streets in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; We found the end, about 1900 kilometers from the foot of Yonge St. in Toronto.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just a few hundred feet from the border crossing&nbsp;at Rainy River to the USA. </p>
<p>We enjoyed Fort Francis and stayed at a campground in the beautiful municipal park.&nbsp; On Sunday Sept 4th, we were on our way to Thunder Bay with a quick visit to Atikokan just off the highway.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="239" alt="IMG_3214_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3214_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Before you get to Thunder Bay,&nbsp; Hwy 11 drops south to Kakabeka Falls.&nbsp; It is very impressive, and the way the walkways are built around it there are some spectacular views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We stayed that night at Thunder Bay and early the next morning went to Old Fort William.&nbsp; It is a reconstruction of the Fort William that stood on the banks of the Kaministikwia River a number of miles away. The original site is now a railway freight yard and several city blocks of buildings.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="IMG_3224_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3224_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The fort&rsquo;s buildings and layout was built from historical sketches and descriptions, archaeological findings and simple deduction.&nbsp; They used the construction techniques to make sure the place was put up the way forts were truly built centuries ago.&nbsp; The staff are all in period costume and take on the life of one of the occupants of the fort.&nbsp; A most interesting morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_3231" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3231_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />That afternoon we headed home.&nbsp; Over the next few days we&nbsp;travelled via the north shore of Superior,&nbsp;across into the USA at the &ldquo;Soo&rdquo; so we could visit cousins in Michigan &ndash; thanks Brent and Mary for your hospitality.&nbsp; While in Michigan we went to Hell and back.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small&nbsp;hamlet about 45 miles west of Detroit.&nbsp; They told us that it is impossible for them to keep the sign &ldquo;Welcome to Hell&rdquo; from being stolen.&nbsp; We crossed over&nbsp;into Canada at Windsor visiting with&nbsp;Bernie&rsquo;s sister, along the north shore of Lake Erie for a visit with Ross&rsquo;s cousins at Turkey Point and finally home on Sept 11th to the KOA at Milton.</p>
<p>We made it in time to greet our elder daughter, Mandi.&nbsp; She arrived that night from her home in the Bahamas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is another story which&nbsp;we will write about in our next journal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Till then; </p>
<p>Ross and Bernie</p>
