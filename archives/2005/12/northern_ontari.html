<h3>Northern Ontario to Home</h3>

<p>It has been a few months since I sent out the last journal and we have been home and are now back on the road.&nbsp; While we were home we had a very busy time and I didn&rsquo;t get the last journal sent out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soooooo &mdash; here is the last of the trip west.&nbsp; Following this we will update you on our time at home and our new journey.<br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 322px; HEIGHT: 175px" height="170" alt="DSC_0123_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0123_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="200" alt="DSC_0125_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0125_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Northern Ontario is wonderful clear lakes and tumbling waterfalls and of course TREES.&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles and miles and miles of trees.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0128" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0128_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Highway 11 in Ontario&nbsp;is one of &nbsp;the longest streets in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; We found the end, about 1900 kilometers from the foot of Yonge St. in Toronto.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just a few hundred feet from the border crossing&nbsp;at Rainy River to the USA. </p>
<p>We enjoyed Fort Francis and stayed at a campground in the beautiful municipal park.&nbsp; On Sunday Sept 4th, we were on our way to Thunder Bay with a quick visit to Atikokan just off the highway.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="239" alt="IMG_3214_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3214_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Before you get to Thunder Bay,&nbsp; Hwy 11 drops south to Kakabeka Falls.&nbsp; It is very impressive, and the way the walkways are built around it there are some spectacular views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We stayed that night at Thunder Bay and early the next morning went to Old Fort William.&nbsp; It is a reconstruction of the Fort William that stood on the banks of the Kaministikwia River a number of miles away. The original site is now a railway freight yard and several city blocks of buildings.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="IMG_3224_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3224_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The fort&rsquo;s buildings and layout was built from historical sketches and descriptions, archaeological findings and simple deduction.&nbsp; They used the construction techniques to make sure the place was put up the way forts were truly built centuries ago.&nbsp; The staff are all in period costume and take on the life of one of the occupants of the fort.&nbsp; A most interesting morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_3231" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3231_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />That afternoon we headed home.&nbsp; Over the next few days we&nbsp;travelled via the north shore of Superior,&nbsp;across into the USA at the &ldquo;Soo&rdquo; so we could visit cousins in Michigan &ndash; thanks Brent and Mary for your hospitality.&nbsp; While in Michigan we went to Hell and back.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small&nbsp;hamlet about 45 miles west of Detroit.&nbsp; They told us that it is impossible for them to keep the sign &ldquo;Welcome to Hell&rdquo; from being stolen.&nbsp; We crossed over&nbsp;into Canada at Windsor visiting with&nbsp;Bernie&rsquo;s sister, along the north shore of Lake Erie for a visit with Ross&rsquo;s cousins at Turkey Point and finally home on Sept 11th to the KOA at Milton.</p>
<p>We made it in time to greet our elder daughter, Mandi.&nbsp; She arrived that night from her home in the Bahamas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is another story which&nbsp;we will write about in our next journal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Till then; </p>
<p>Ross and Bernie</p>

<p>Hey Bernice!</p>

<p>Glad to see my email box full of your adventures! I was just think about you yesterday (at our coffee hour that still goes on most Fridays), and I was wondering why we hadn't heard in so long. I'm in Collingwood for the weekend enjoy some snowshoeing and snowboarding. </p>

<p>Happy trails, and hello from all of us back at 245 Carlaw!</p>

<p>Great to get your update and know that you are safe and sound and well!  Happy New Year to you both!  Can't tell you how much I miss the great service and the banter.  The new folks are really nice people, but if the "service" I get is any indicator.  Enough said.<br />
If you ever decide to reopen elsewhere, please let me know!  Regards and best wishes</p>
