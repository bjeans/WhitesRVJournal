<p>Our Thanksgiving this year was very special as we celebrated it with our first grandchild.&nbsp; Ricardo Ross Walker, 8lbs 3oz and&nbsp;21&rdquo; long, arrived safely&nbsp;on September 29, 2005 at about 6 PM.&nbsp; Mother and son both doing well.</p>
<p>Our daughter, Mandi, came&nbsp;back to Canada on September 11<font size="2">th</font>, from her home in the Bahamas so that she could have the baby here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricardo decided to&nbsp;arrive early and his father, Quincy,&nbsp;unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t get air connections fast enough and didn&rsquo;t arrive until about midnight that night.</p>
<p>Our younger daughter and her husband, had moved to a new home in Cambridge the first of July.&nbsp; Mandi and Quincy were fortunately able to stay with them while here in&nbsp;Canada.&nbsp; They went back&nbsp;home to the Bahamas October 20<font size="2">th</font>.&nbsp; How wonderful it was to&nbsp;be able to have this time with our girls and their husbands &ndash;&nbsp;and Ricardo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how such a little bundle can take over your heart!&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we started this adventure on the road, we didn&rsquo;t have any experience and&nbsp;we didn&rsquo;t know how long we would continue.&nbsp; We wanted to see whether in really was for us on not.</p>
<p>We like it.&nbsp; We expect to continue.&nbsp; We have been having fun.&nbsp; But &ndash; the slide on the Jayco trailer was only 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; and Ross is 6&rsquo;3&rdquo;.&nbsp; Needless to say he hit his head on numerous occasions which took the edge off his enjoyment.&nbsp; We decided, if we were going to keep on travelling, we should&nbsp;make a trade&nbsp;for a new one with higher&nbsp;interior space.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0152" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0152_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We have a new trailer &ndash; it is still a 5th wheel, a Hitchhiker II and is 34&rsquo; long (the old one was 32&rsquo;).&nbsp; It has 3 slides &ndash; one for the bedroom and one on each side of the living room (the old one had 2 slides).&nbsp; Most importantly, the slides and bedroom are high enough that Ross can stand up straight without hitting his head.&nbsp; So far we are very happy with it and the extra&nbsp;space is great as it makes our living area about 14&rsquo; wide.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_3233" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_3233_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />While home we went to Milton fair,&nbsp;visited friends &amp;&nbsp;office colleagues, Bernie painted, Ross played??? golf (for the first time in 30 years) and&nbsp;we both gave landscaping assistance at Barnaby &amp; Shell&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; We went to dentists, doctors and had our eyes checked.&nbsp; Bernie had surgery (she is fine) and had to take it easy for a number of weeks.&nbsp; We spent time with sisters and sister-in-law and other family.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>And now we are ready to go again.&nbsp; December 7th is D (Departure) date.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll&nbsp;be in touch from the road.</p>
<p>Ross and Bernie</p>

<p>Congrats on your new RV--looks pretty plush and it is great that you are enjoying and seeing so much of the country.  Doubt we will be doing much traveling anymore--just doesn't seem to fit into things and gas prices are so expensive & that really gets to John.  Did not realize that Ontario was so gorgeous--Canada is such an incredible country.  You are very fortunate to live there.   Sincerely, Bette</p>

<p>Hi Bernie and Ross,</p>

<p>Wow, I'm so impressed with your wonderful journal. The photos bring your adventures to life for us and with some of them, I swear I can actually hear the water flowing. I can also imagine how well Bernie will put them to canvas.</p>

<p>May you both stay well, stay happy, may the big guy (no not Ross) keep you safe. Congratulations on the arrival of your handsome new grandson.<br />
And may the wind stay at your back and the road ahead be filled with yet more lovely adventures.</p>

<p>We're thinking of you!<br />
Cheers<br />
