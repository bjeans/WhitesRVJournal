<h3>CHAPTER 2 – TRIP #1</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Hello again &hellip; and welcome back to the saga of 2 recent retirees, on the road.&nbsp; We've completed 'the shakedown cruise'.&nbsp; Ten states plus Ontario, 26 days, 6714 kilometers and WE'RE STILL MARRIED.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><img height="199" alt="Chapter2" hspace="10" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Chapter2.jpg" width="300" align="left" border="2" /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">With all the post 9-11 publicity about how hard it is to get into the U.S., we had allowed two hours to get across the border.&nbsp; At the Thousand Islands bridge, we stopped first at Canada Customs to register all the cameras, TV's, radios and scanners and other electronics in the trailer.&nbsp; Upon presenting a full page list of stuff, single spaced, to the Canada Customs inspector; we waited a moment for him to read it and then come to the trailer for an inspection. He had a quick look, stamped it and wished us a safe trip - in total, about 2 minutes and he never got out of his chair.&nbsp; Across the bridge to the U.S. side, no line-up, to the inspection there.&nbsp; We presented our passports, were asked how long we planned on being there and if we had any alcohol or tobacco.&nbsp; That's all folks - no inspection or anything - in total about 1 minute.&nbsp; Boy was it tough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Visits with family and friends, great scenery, 26 kilometers of single lane Interstate with concrete barriers on both sides with no passing lanes or pull offs.&nbsp; I certainly learned how to steer our big rig and had to back in to our campsites 3 times - and I made it. Phew!!!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Three or four highlights stand out - Cape Hatteras and the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina, Talladega NASCAR Speedway near Birmingham Alabama and FDR's Little White House in Warm Springs Georgia.&nbsp; Stay tuned for some details.<br /></p>

<p>Hey you crazy couple - glad to hear you are still married. Ha,ha! I thought you would have said that you eloped to Las Vegas to get remarried, but I guess you are under age to do that huh? What do you have to be, at least 16 to get married there??? So, you really know how to keep people in suspense by leaving us hanging on those high light spots. Guess I will have to stay tuned. What rock station are you on?<br />
Well keep on R.V.ing and don't run anybody over, especially when you are parking.<br />
Have fun!<br />
