<h3>Nothern Prairies</h3>

<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0061" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0061_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />It&rsquo;s amazing how we have gotten into a routine.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter where we are or what our plans are for the day &ndash; we don&rsquo;t get away from our overnight camp until around 10 AM.&nbsp; Sure, sometimes it&rsquo;s a half hour earlier or later, but in general it&rsquo;s 10.&nbsp; That is unless we stay at a WalMart and then we do seem to get on the road earlier.&nbsp; This picture was taken at 9:20 after we had been on the road for awhile.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is northern Saskatchewan and we were very suprised at the amount of oil that we saw.&nbsp; In the east we think of Alberta oil and I&rsquo;m sure it is there, but we saw more working pumps in Saskatchewan.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0070_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0070_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp;After all the twisting roads of the mountains it was soothing to drive relatively straight for awhile.&nbsp; The land is quite rolling but as you can see there are some wonderful vistas.&nbsp; The biggest land elevation changes are not &ldquo;up&rdquo;, but&nbsp;&ldquo;down&rdquo; into the river valleys.&nbsp; These are wonderful with trees and grazing areas along the rivers.&nbsp; We&nbsp;crossed the North Saskatchewan River&nbsp;shortly&nbsp;after we under way and came to it again at&nbsp;our destination today, Prince Albert.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went into town late in the afternoon but were in time to visit the home of former Prime Minister, the late John Diefenbaker.&nbsp; It was interesting &ndash; he lived quite a simple life before Ottawa.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0088" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0088_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />A pelican??&nbsp; A white pelican calmly walking down the side of the road!&nbsp; We thought that we were seeing things, but no, apparently there is a large colony of this endangered bird, in Prince Albert National Park which is located about 100 KM north of the city.&nbsp; We spent the whole day at the park and had hoped to hike some of the 100 km of trails.&nbsp; Unfortunately, today, after&nbsp;2 1/2 months of good weather, it decided to rain.&nbsp; We&nbsp;only did short hikes into the 1,496 sq. mi. of wilderness. And they have kept it wilderness, as the road only&nbsp;goes through a&nbsp;small&nbsp;area at the south east corner.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0090" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0090_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />The next day, Aug 31, we headed east along Hwy 3.&nbsp; The land here is prairie.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t realized that the huge fields and wide expanses&nbsp;of grain extended this far north.&nbsp; And we are quite north.&nbsp; This picture was taken about 53<font face="WP MathA">E</font>latitude &ndash; compare that to 45<font face="WP MathA">E</font><font face="Times New Roman">at Gravenhurst, Ontario and 51.3<font face="WP MathA">E</font></font><font face="Times New Roman">at Mosanee, Ontario.&nbsp; We continued east in rain, torrential rain and wind.&nbsp; We have not driven in this kind of weather on the trip.&nbsp; We had considered going further north to Flin Flon and The Pas but with the weather, just kept going into Manitoba and turned south to Swan River for the night.&nbsp; We parked in the campground on a small island of relative dry, surrounded by water.</font><br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0092_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0092_edited_small3.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Cloudy and overcast with some rain, but nothing like the day before, we continued across Manitoba.&nbsp; Our first stop was at Winnipegosis on Lake Winnipegosis where we discovered this wonderful old grain elevator.&nbsp; Most of these are now being abandoned in favour or the new steel and high tech complexes.&nbsp; This one, although gradually deteriorating, was still in reasonable state.&nbsp; Bernie took a number of pictures that she can use as references in future paintings.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0103" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0103_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0117_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0117_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC_0122" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0122_small.jpg" width="159" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>That evening we camped at the Lion&rsquo;s Park in Neepawa, north west of Portage La Prairie.&nbsp; I think we have all heard about the mosquito problem in Manitoba.&nbsp; This Martin house complex in the campground must work as we didn&rsquo;t see one mosquito that evening.&nbsp; It had been interesting when we arrived &ndash;&nbsp;we went to the campground office and ask for a space, saying we didn&rsquo;t need any services, just a place to park.&nbsp; The manager sent us across the road to the park and told us to park anywhere&nbsp;that was convenient.&nbsp; When I offered to pay her, she said, &ldquo; If you don&rsquo;t need any services, I don&rsquo;t need any money.&nbsp; Enjoy your evening&rdquo;.&nbsp; Pretty nice, eh?</p>
<p>The next morning, after an oil change, we headed east again, bypassing Winnipeg and&nbsp;continuing on to east of Kenora before we stopped for the night.&nbsp; Tomorrow, Sept 3, we are headed to Fort Francis, ON an area we have never been too.</p>
<p>Talk to you from there</p>
