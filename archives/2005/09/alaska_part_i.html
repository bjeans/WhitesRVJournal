<h3>Alaska - Part I</h3>

<p>We crossed into Canada of Wed. July 27th and it was very easy.&nbsp; Took about 2 minutes as there was no line up at all and customs basically waved us through.&nbsp; Our campground was only about 5 km from the border&nbsp;and from there&nbsp;over the next couple of days we&nbsp;toured the White Rock, Langley, Surrey area.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had&nbsp;arranged with&nbsp;the campground&nbsp;to park the trailer in a field while we were on the Alaska cruise.&nbsp; We had planned on going in to Vancouver and staying in a hotel close to the dock on Friday &ndash; but &ndash; when we found out that the hotels in that area were $250 to $300 per night we went to plan B.&nbsp; We stayed at the campground one more night.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="240" alt="DSC_0004_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0004_edited_small1.jpg" width="159" align="left" vspace="15" border="2" /></p>
<p>That Friday evening, we were entertained when&nbsp;a hot air balloon crew arrived and set up&nbsp;in the field&nbsp;about 100 yards from us.&nbsp; They do charter rides and had 11 people they were taking up.&nbsp; It was most intriging to watch the whole&nbsp;process. They can&rsquo;t control where they go so they have a chase car that follows as best it can to pick up the passengers when it lands.&nbsp; If we had gone downtown to a hotel we would have missed this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;As&nbsp;we were almost due&nbsp;to have an oil change, tire rotation and differential service, we contacted a GM dealer in the city and made arrangements to have it done while we were away.&nbsp; They did the work and then kept the truck for us for the week&nbsp;and even paid for the cab ride to the ship. &nbsp;Had we left the truck at the campground the cab would have been about $90.<br clear="left">We met Barnaby &amp; Michelle, who had our tickets, and then boarded the ship &ndash; Holland America&rsquo;s Zaandam &ndash; about noon on Saturday.&nbsp; Barnaby&rsquo;s parents were also on the cruise, as well as his grandmother, an aunt &amp; uncle&nbsp;from England and great aunt and cousins from Vancouver Island.&nbsp; There were 12 in&nbsp;our group.&nbsp; It was great to have others on the cruise to meet for meals, etc. but we all did our own thing during the day and while on shore. </p>
<p>On boarding, we of course&nbsp;headed directly to the lunch buffet as our luggage and rooms would not be ready until later that afternoon.&nbsp; One thing we learned quickly is that you never go hungry.&nbsp; The food was excellent with lots of choices and at least one restaurant was open at all times. Our dinner seating in the more formal dining room was at 7:45 and we had a window table.&nbsp; The service was wonderful and nothing seemed too much trouble for any staff member.&nbsp; That was true all over the ship, everyone went out of their way to provide you with every service, right down to carrying your tray from the buffet line to a table.</p>
<p>We left the dock in Vancouver at 5 PM and sailed up the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the mainland. Sunday we continued up the Inside Passage with signs of civilization becoming less and less.&nbsp; At one point we had a whole school of dolphins playing around the ship.&nbsp; The sea was quite calm although&nbsp;on Sunday morning as we were in Queen Charlotte Sound away from land there was quite a roll.&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner had we noticed the rolling, than we could feel the stabilizers employed and the ship settled right down again.</p>

<p>We were awakened on Monday morning by the speaker in our room&nbsp;announcing that we had arrived in Tracy Arm.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a beautiful fjord just south of Juneau.&nbsp; We saw our first iceburgs &ndash; not the huge ones that you see in pictures, but small ones floating everywhere.&nbsp; They were the most beautiful blue and when the sun shone through them were almost irridescent.&nbsp; The water is also blue green which is a result of the glacial silt that is carried by the streams from the glaciers.&nbsp; As we left Tracy Arm we went through a fog bank so thick that you couldn&rsquo;t see.</p>
