<h2>February 19, 2007</h2>

<h3>Nevada</h3>

<p>On Monday morning June 13th&nbsp; we headed straight south from Jerome on US 93 to Wells Nevada where we turned west on I-80.&nbsp; The land we have come through has gotten progressively drier and from the flat plains of the Snake River we are into much hillier terrain.&nbsp; There is still snow on some of the mountain tops but they are not rugged like the ones north of Arco ID.</p>
<p>We had heard that&nbsp;travellers were welcome to stay overnight in WalMart parking lots so we decided to stop at the store&nbsp;in Winnemucca NV.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not where we will stay most of the time but it sure is nice to know that it is available &ndash; and it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0111a_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0111a_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />On the way to Carson City, the capital of Nevada,&nbsp;there are many &ldquo;lakes&rdquo; but they had no water in them.&nbsp; Only when it rains do they fill up for a short while. We turned off the Interstate and went south through the Carson Sink which is the most desolate, dry and parched area we have ever seen.&nbsp; The road ran dead straight with no elevation changes for close to 30 miles.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be lost out there as there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any landmark to help you.</p>
<p>As we had only driven about 170 miles (and we were&nbsp;on the road&nbsp;early since we were in WalMart&rsquo;s parking lot&nbsp;and their PA system started about 6:30) we got into Carson City and set up by shortly after noon.&nbsp;&nbsp; On local advice, we decided to take the Kingsbury Grade road over the mountains to South Lake Tahoe.&nbsp; Let me tell you, it&rsquo;s one steep &ldquo;grade&rdquo; with many 25 MPH curves&nbsp;and we were&nbsp;very glad that we were not towing the trailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0112a_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0112a_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>South Lake Tahoe is&nbsp;quite commercial and access to the beach is not very easy.&nbsp; The town itself if&nbsp;really pretty with the structures all&nbsp; made of materials to suit the environment.&nbsp; This picture is of the Marriott Grand Mansion Hotel and is&nbsp;typical of the buildings.&nbsp; The homes are quite beautiful and certainly are not what one thinks of as a cottage or cabin.&nbsp; The temperature at the lake was about 10 degrees F lower than in the valley.</p><br clear="left">
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0116b_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0116b_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Even as easterners&nbsp;we had heard of the Comstock Lode, so since we were close by, we visited Virginia City where gold was found in 1870 and silver shortly after.&nbsp; The hills surrounding the town poured an estimated $400,000,000 into the economy,&nbsp;some of which was used to build San Francisco and also to help finance the Union <br clear="left"><img height="213" alt="DSC_0124a_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0124a_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Army during the Civil War.&nbsp;At one point it had a population of 30,000 with 100 saloons, many churches, banks and theatres &ndash;&nbsp;and the only elevator between Chicago and San Francisco.&nbsp; Today the population is about 900.&nbsp; We followed another mountain road back.&nbsp; The view to Reno in the valley was great.</p>
<p>With dire prediction about a storm and high winds approaching from the Pacific we decided to stay put in Carson City for an extra day.&nbsp; The road in the&nbsp;valley to Reno is closed when there are high winds.&nbsp; The storm never materialized on the east side of the mountains, although there were banks of clouds over the peaks all day.</p>
<p>Did I say we did a little gambling?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a strong person who could go to Nevada and not put a quarter or two into the slots.&nbsp; Sorry, we didn&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>In Reno we stayed quite close into town so could walk to a couple of the bigger casinos. Went downtown and walked around but it really is just a smaller Las Vegas.&nbsp; <img height="240" alt="IMG_2819_edited" hspace="5" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2819_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />On Sunday we did go up to Truckee, then on to the north side of Lake Tahoe.&nbsp; Truckee is a wonderfully restored historic town but of most importance &ndash; IT&rsquo;S a TRAIN TOWN.&nbsp; We were there when an eastbound Union Pacific and a westbound BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) met followed shortly by Amtrak&rsquo;s&nbsp;California Zephyr.&nbsp; Ross had his train fix for the day (week?).<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0132a_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0132a_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Just south of Truckee is Squaw Valley, site of the 1960 winter Olympics.&nbsp; It seems to suddenly appear out of the thousands of pines hugging the road.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, since it is summer, there is very little going on.&nbsp; We then followed the road to&nbsp;Tahoe City and on around the north side of Lake Tahoe.<br clear="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0135a_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0135a_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />From the north road we could see the lake much better and it is very large &ndash; 22 miles long and 12 miles wide.&nbsp; At its deepest it is 1,645 feet and is at an elevation of 6,229 feet.&nbsp; The lake is a very beautiful blue and is rimmed by mountains.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday June 21st, we&rsquo;re heading to California.&nbsp;</p>
