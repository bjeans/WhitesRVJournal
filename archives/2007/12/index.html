<h2>December 28, 2007</h2>


<h3 id="a000136">Viet Nam - Hanoi & Halong Bay</h3>

<p><img height="237" alt="IMG_5726_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5726_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Sunday, June 3rd after breakfast we headed from our hotel in Ho Chi Minh City to the airport for our 2 hour flight to Hanoi, arriving about 1:30 pm.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Immediately after checking in to the Sheraton Hotel, we were given a pedicab tour of the Old Quarters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>June is into the rainy season which means that at any time the heavens will open.&nbsp; We had to take refuge in a sidewalk cafe to escape the downpour.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_5720_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5720_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The Old Quarters is made up of about&nbsp;36 shopping streets, each street named for its primary goods.&nbsp; This picture was taken on the &ldquo;footwear&rdquo; street.&nbsp; We also saw, &ldquo;silver&rdquo;, &ldquo;paper&rdquo; &ldquo;flowers&rdquo; and many other specialities.&nbsp; The streets are very narrow and cars are not allowed down them.&nbsp; As the vendors were taxed on the width of their stalls, living quarters and workshops went to the back, creating &ldquo;tube houses&rdquo;, 3 meters wide by up to 60 meters deep.<br clear="right"><img style="WIDTH: 342px; HEIGHT: 193px" height="152" alt="P1010528E" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010528E_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>We saw many unusual products being transported by bicycle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Labour is cheap as evidenced by the woman cleaning the side of the road with a twig broom.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 240px; HEIGHT: 242px" height="318" alt="IMG_5734_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5734_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 247px; HEIGHT: 206px" height="261" alt="IMG_5704_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5704_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="187" alt="P1010609" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010609_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>After the tour of the city we were treated to a performance of the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre.&nbsp; Instead of being controlled by strings from above, the puppeteers are behind the backdrop and manipulate the puppets by long poles that are concealed by the water.&nbsp; A most unique show!<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="198" alt="IMG_5792_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5792_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Ha Long Bay &ndash; a seascape of limestone mountains, emerging from a clear blue sea.</p>
<p>On Monday the 4th,&nbsp;we took a full day trip to visit this beautiful area, 165 km from Hanoi.</p>
<p>On arrival at Ha Long City, we boarded a boat and had a two hour cruise&nbsp;through these wonderful shapes.&nbsp; Lunch was served on board and Bernie bought some lovely pearls.&nbsp; The boat in the picture below is similar to the one we were on.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="212" alt="IMG_5766_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5766_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="186" alt="IMG_5783_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5783_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="155" alt="IMG_5804_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5804_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The area between Hanoi and Ha Long Bay has thousands of acres of rice&nbsp; paddies and all of it appears to be farmed by hand, primarily by the women.</p>
<p>It was about 34C (95F) and they were dressed in&nbsp;long pants, smocks with&nbsp;long sleeves and conical hats.&nbsp; The rice sheaves were hand cut and tied and then loaded on to a cart that was pulled by one woman and pushed by another to the side of the road.<br clear="left">&nbsp; <img height="240" alt="P1010617" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010617_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The sheaves were lined up along the edge of the road to dry.&nbsp; When dry&nbsp;they were taken, again by cart, to the threshing machine (the only mechanical item we saw).</p>
<p>From there, the rice&nbsp; were spread out on the driveways to finish drying and to be cleaned of chaff, before it was sold.</p>
<p>The chaff was removed by pouring&nbsp;the grain&nbsp;from basket to basket with the wind blowing.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="229" alt="P1010704" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010704_small.jpg" width="365" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>In the morning of&nbsp;our last full day in Vietnam, June 5th, we visited the tomb of Ho Chi Minh, the most important figure in modern Vietnam History.</p>
<p>In Vietnam today, Ho Chi Minh, the man&nbsp;is considered to be the very soul of the countries struggle for independence.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1010743" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010743_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />He died in Ha Noi in Sept. 1969 and his embalmed body is on display in a mausoleum which was&nbsp;erected in his honour at the end of the war in 1975.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mausoleum is modelled after Lenin&rsquo;s Tomb in Moscow.&nbsp; Our guide told us that every day thousands of&nbsp;admirers file past his body, rain or shine, often lining up long before dawn.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this &ldquo;honour&rdquo; is not what he wished.&nbsp; He wanted to be cremated and his ashes buried in urns on hilltops of Viet Nam.<br clear="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height="202" alt="P1010756_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010756_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ho Chi Minh was a very simple person and lived in a very&nbsp;small house, on stilts, close to where the Mausoleum is situated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br clear="left"><img height="194" alt="P1010741" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010741_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Canadian Embassy is located&nbsp;at the&nbsp;approach to&nbsp;the Mausoleum Square.&nbsp; We tried to get a picture of it, but the Vietnamese guards would not allow us to take any of the buildings.&nbsp; They finally let us take one of the plaque.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>That afternoon we spent walking around the local area.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we crossed one of the local streets, we noticed again that to successfully navigate it, once you start, you don&rsquo;t stop. When we got to the other side, Ross said &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even bother me anymore &ndash; It&rsquo;s interesting what you can get used to&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The next morning at 11:05 am, we flew out of Hanoi to Hong Kong on our first leg of the flight home.&nbsp;&nbsp;We finally arrived&nbsp;at Toronto airport at 10:00 pm that night.&nbsp; Given the time change and crossing the international date line, we had been en route home for 23 hours.</p>
<p>At times it is hard to believe that we were really there, it seems almost like a dream.&nbsp; But then, we look at the pictures and we really were standing on The Great Wall and walking through Angkor Wat.</p>
<p>A trip of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
