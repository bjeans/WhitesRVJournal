<h3>Mexico - Part I</h3>

<p>Sunday, Feb 25th we headed south from Tucson to cross the border at Nogales.&nbsp; First of course we had to stop and purchase automobile insurance.&nbsp; Your U.S. or Canadian insurance does not cover you in Mexico.&nbsp; It is reasonably expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; It cost us $286.35 U.S. for 14 days of liability coverage on the truck and trailer and collision&nbsp; on the truck.&nbsp; The agent told us that once you reach 35 days it is cheaper to purchase an annual policy.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4395_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4395_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Once again, there was no personal inspection or stop going into Mexico, although 21 km down the road&nbsp;we needed to stop to obtain a visitors visa which costs about $24 U.S. each.. 
<p>The landscape here is very similar to southern Arizona, with desert shrubs and huge piles of rock erupting from the earth.&nbsp; We passed some very large greenhouse complexes that appeared to be hydroponic agriculture.&nbsp; They were set right in the middle of barren desert and certainly would get all the sun that they need.<br clear="left">
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4392_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4392_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /> 
<p>We stopped in Santa Ana for an excellent lunch at a roadside stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was our first chance to see up close (and while not moving) some of the houses that had&nbsp;been visible as we drove along.&nbsp; We were amazed at the housing in so much of the area that we visited.&nbsp; &nbsp;Shelter&nbsp;is made of anything; plywood, canvas, tin sheets,corrugated metal, cardboard &ndash; anything available.&nbsp; However, no matter how rudimentary the house, there was&nbsp;most&nbsp;often a line of clean wash hanging out.&nbsp; Even in such a basic shelter as the one in this picture, there is occasionally an air conditioner.&nbsp; You can see it through the wall on the right hand side.&nbsp; It gets very, very hot in the summer.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="237" alt="IMG_4437_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4437_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We arrived in San Carlos late in the afternoon,&nbsp;after a very long drive which took us along the edge of Hermosillo and then about 90 miles further south to just north west&nbsp;of Guaymas &ndash; a total of 330 miles from the campground in Tucson.&nbsp; The highway is 4 lane all the way, however as you go through the villages and towns speed is reduced.&nbsp; Not just reduced, almost stopped.&nbsp; They control the speed by &ldquo;topes&rdquo; (speed bumps) and they are so severe that you need to drop to a crawl not to damage your vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the open highway there are no &ldquo;topes&rdquo; but there is also no shoulder to the road and the drop off from the pavement can be anywhere from 2 inches to 2 feet.&nbsp; There are signs warning of the sharp edge but as would be expected, they are in Spanish.&nbsp; Our Spanish/English dictionary got a good workout figuring out the&nbsp;traffic signs.</p>
<p>The road is in good repair and very busy.&nbsp; It is the main highway down the west side of Mexico and is well travelled by 18 wheelers and intercity buses.&nbsp; There are pull offs quite often, however again the pavement drops down 4 to 10 inches at them, so we didn&rsquo;t even attempt to take a break there with the trailer behind us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were glad to arrive.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_2462_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2462_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>San Carlos is&nbsp;located on a bay in the Sea of Cortez and we stayed&nbsp;at a park quite close to the older area of&nbsp; town.&nbsp; We walked in to the grocery store and to the fruit &amp; vegetable stand.&nbsp; One day we drove to the end of the road and the viewpoint out over the Sea of Cortez.&nbsp; Looking back&nbsp;from the viewpoint you could see the mountain that overlooks the town and was so obvious as we arrived.&nbsp; These are big hills &ndash; that is a dirt road at the bottom left, on the closest hill in the picture.<br clear="right"><img height="213" alt="DSC_2474_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2474_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We went in to Guaymas on Thursday.&nbsp; It is a city of more than 125,000 and is an old port, now a fishing centre.&nbsp; It also is a departure point for one of the ferries across the Sea of Cortez to the Baja.&nbsp; There is a central square and a central market.&nbsp; We ended up at Ley&rsquo;s, which is a large Mexican supermarket chain and has excellent selection.&nbsp; In driving through parts of the city, we saw&nbsp;extreme poverty and also quite lavish homes.&nbsp; This seems to be an area of great contrasts.<br clear="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_2478_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2478_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />On Friday we visited a Pearl Farm operation.&nbsp; This is the only pearl farm in the Sea of Cortez.&nbsp; The oysters that are used are only found in this one area of the world.&nbsp; The farm was started by 3 University students as&nbsp;an experiment for their Master&rsquo;s degree thesis.&nbsp; It turned out to be successful and they now operate it commercially. They produce beautifully coloured pearls &ndash;&nbsp;blues, greens, grays, pinks&nbsp;and also half pearls in the same colours.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;a great free tour and one I would recommend to&nbsp;everyone.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>That afternoon we went golfing at the course in San Carlos.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t have great scores but did enjoy ourselves.&nbsp; In the evening we went for dinner with some new acquaintances, Bob and Joann.&nbsp; The restaurant is a teaching facility and when we ordered Caesar Salad, we were treated to approximately a 15 minute preparation done step by step right at our table.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that Caesar Salad was invented in Mexico? We didn&rsquo;t know that either.</p>
<p><img height="237" alt="IMG_4440_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4440_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We enjoyed our time in San Carlos and would certainly go back there again.&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was wonderful &ndash;&nbsp;about 80 to 85 F during the day with only about 15% humidity and at&nbsp;night&nbsp;you really did need a sweater&nbsp;or light jacket.</p>
<p>There were good restaurants, the golf course and Guaymas only 20 Km away.</p>
<p>But, it still really isn&rsquo;t the Mexico that we thought we might find this far south of the U.S. border.&nbsp; I guess the west coast of Mexico on the Sea of Cortez has had so much tourism that it is bound to feel Americanised.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On Sunday,&nbsp;March 4th, we headed north and then west again to Bahia de&nbsp;Keno, also on the Sea of Cortez.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let you know what we found there in the next journal.</p>
<p>Till then</p>

<p>Hi<br />
Good to hear from you--Mexico has never interested me and still doesn't.  Will send you a letter at your normal adress soon to tell you our plans in Canada.  We will be staying a week just north of Quebec City so will have several days to visit it.  Anyway, it still sounds as if you are having too much fun!!!!!!!!!!  Bette</p>
