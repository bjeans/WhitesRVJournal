<h3>Alberta</h3>

<p>It is only a short trip of about 225 km from Field, BC to&nbsp;Chestermere, AB&nbsp;(east of Calgary)&nbsp;which was our destination for the day, but once again we went through some magnificent&nbsp;views in the Rockies.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0010_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0010_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_0018_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0018_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We arrived in Banff in time to wander around the town before lunch.&nbsp; It certainly caters to tourists, but has avoided being tacky.&nbsp; We felt that the town has maintained a presence that fits in with the&nbsp;incredible scenery that surrounds it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="187" alt="DSC_0022_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0022_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />The road toward Calgary&nbsp;runs through&nbsp;the Bow River valley and for about another 40 kilometres we were still overshadowed by the towering peaks.&nbsp; The area around Canmore is particularly beautiful with the Three Sisters dominating the landscape.&nbsp; Every direction you look there are massive mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words are inadequate to describe the mountains.&nbsp; At once you are amazed at the stunning and&nbsp;awesome beauty,&nbsp; you&nbsp;feel&nbsp;overpowered by the shear size and mass of the rock and you are astounded by the forces that created them.&nbsp; As much as seeing &ndash;&nbsp;you feel them.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="256" alt="DSC_0038_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0038_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />And suddenly you are out of them and into the rolling foothills west of Calgary.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;you look&nbsp;behind you, you can see the mountains looming there, but as you continue east they gradually disappear into the haze and you&rsquo;re not sure then, if it&rsquo;s the mountains or a cloud bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spent a couple of nights in the Calgary area where we visited with Bernie&rsquo;s cousin Carl &amp; his wife Shannon.&nbsp; Thanks cuz, those Alberta steaks were great!<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="206" alt="DSC_0043_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0043_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Early Saturday, August 27th, we headed north.&nbsp; We are now in country where the sky seems endless.&nbsp; What a change from the mountains just a short distance to the west!&nbsp; Early on,&nbsp;we think we can still see them, but as the mountains angle to the north west and we are heading straight north they have soon totally disappeared.&nbsp; We will miss them as we have been surrounded by or at least able to see mountains of all types since we approached Yellowstone the first of June.&nbsp; I guess that&rsquo;s not exactly true as there were no real mountains in southern Idaho or eastern Nevada &ndash; but you get the idea.</p>
<p>We stayed to the east of Edmonton and decided to treat ourselves to Sunday brunch in the city with friends.&nbsp; Deborah and George, it was great fun.&nbsp; Hope to see you in November when you come to Toronto.</p>
<p><img height="283" alt="DSC_0049c_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0049c_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon we headed east.&nbsp; From now on that will be the main direction of our travel as we are headed back to Ontario.&nbsp; Our elder daughter Amanda, who lives in the Bahamas, is expecting our first grandchild in October.&nbsp; She is coming home to have the baby here and will be arriving on Sept 11th.&nbsp; That is our target date to be back close to Cambridge, where she will be staying with our other daughter Michelle.</p>
<p>The road east goes past Vegreville, the centre of eastern Alberta&rsquo;s Ukrainian culture, &nbsp;where you can find the world&rsquo;s largest Ukrainian Easter Egg or <em>pysanka.&nbsp; </em>It&rsquo;s 31 ft. high and made of more than 3,500 pieces of bronze, gold and silver aluminium.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_0055_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0055_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The land is still generally flat and we see many large herds of cattle.&nbsp; This area has more grassland than grain&nbsp;and does seem very prosperous although the ranch buildings are distant from each other.</p>
<p>We arrived in Lloydminster in the late&nbsp;afternoon and went to the visitor centre to get maps and information on Saskatchewan.&nbsp; Lloydminster is a city divided.&nbsp; Well, at least one half is in Alberta and the other half is in Saskatchewan.&nbsp; Common to them both however, is the number of heavy oil refineries.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the chief industry in the town.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we were at the visitor centre, we ask for directions to the campgrounds in the area.&nbsp; This is the first time on our trip that we have encountered no vacancies.&nbsp; Fortunately, there was a WalMart in town so we stayed there in the parking lot.&nbsp; The Husky Truck Stop said that we were welcome to stay in their lot as well.&nbsp; With the solar now working well, we are comfortable anywhere.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, it&rsquo;s into Saskatchewan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>
