<h3>From Tucson to Las Vegas</h3>

<p>We left the casino, south of Tucson, on Saturday morning March 10th.&nbsp; We met my sister Joan on our way through Tucson, as we had left a couple of bags of Texas grapefruit at her place before we went into Mexico.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t bring citrus into the U.S. even if it is U.S. citrus that you are returning with.&nbsp; The Texas grapefruit is so good we didn&rsquo;t want to take a chance that we would lose it.&nbsp; We then stopped in Phoenix overnight before continuing on to Laughlin, Nevada.<img height="210" alt="IMG_4486_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4486_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We followed US 60 then 93 that runs on an angle from Phoenix to Kingman. It is a desolate road after you pass Wickenberg.&nbsp; The land is again dry and there are huge hills with long quite steep grades and deep river valleys.&nbsp; At one point we drove through a very extensive Joshua Tree forest.&nbsp; <br clear="left"><img height="204" alt="IMG_4494_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4494_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were also long valleys as we neared Kingman, AZ.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_4498_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4498_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>From Kingman we went straight west to Laughlin which is on the Colorado River.&nbsp; The road as you go down to the river is a 14 mile hill with a steady 6% grade.&nbsp; Going out the other side to Las Vegas is about a 17 mile uphill pull with about the same grade but at least it does have a few flatter sections.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good thing there is gambling in Laughlin &ndash; there sure isn&rsquo;t any obvious other value to the land in the area.<br clear="left"><img height="228" alt="IMG_4506_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4506_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We arrived in Las Vegas on March 13th and set up at the Circus Circus RV Park, on the north end of the strip.&nbsp; We picked up Mandi, Quincy and Ricardo at the airport that evening.&nbsp; Barn &amp; Shell, as well as Barn&rsquo;s mom and grandmother, were already in Vegas, .&nbsp; The next couple of days we spent&nbsp;being overpowered by the opulence and extravagance of the buildings, decor and&nbsp;facilities. One example is this picture of the hotel complex New York New York!&nbsp; All the buildings are 12 guest towers &ndash; just one hotel.&nbsp; The Statue of Liberty is a faithful copy which rises from a pool of water with a tub-boat and gushing fountains.&nbsp; If you look carefully, you&rsquo;ll see the red roller coaster track through the middle of the resort.&nbsp;<br clear="right"></p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4510_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4510_edited_small.jpg" width="193" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /> 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MGM Lion, weighing some 100,000 lbs,&nbsp;stands 40 to 45 feet high in front of the MGM Grand Hotel.&nbsp; This hotel complex covers over 114 acres, with 5,000 rooms and a 170,000 sq. ft. casino (the size of 4 football fields)<br clear="left">
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4513" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4513_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The old downtown Las Vegas has been revitalised with &ldquo;The Freemont Street Experience, which is a show of 2 million lights on the canopy covering 4 blocks of the street.</p>
<p>The Casinos in the downtown are much smaller, older and less impressive than on the strip, but they still retain the feel of the old Las Vegas.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4523" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4523_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp; <br clear="right">These singing Gondoliers are inside the Venetian Hotel &amp; Casino.&nbsp; The canal winds throughout the hotel and is probably 750 to 1000 feet in length.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t even at ground level.</p>
<p>Barn&rsquo;s grandmother (she is from England and it was her first visit) wondered how she was going to make her friends at home believe that&nbsp;she had had a gondola ride on a Venetian canal, built on the second floor, inside a hotel which itself is built in the desert.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4536_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4536_edited_small.jpg" width="191" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 272px; HEIGHT: 215px" height="240" alt="IMG_4540_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4540_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Las Vegas at night is lights!&nbsp; The Eiffel Tower at the Paris Casino is&nbsp;50 stories high&nbsp;and the dancing waters in Bellagio&rsquo;s 11 acre lake&nbsp;are mesmerizing.&nbsp; Everyone should go to Vegas at least once in their life.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t need to gamble a nickel to enjoy this spectacle in the desert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We left Las Vegas on&nbsp;Friday March 16th having said goodbye to&nbsp;Barn and Shell and family&nbsp;at a great dinner the night before at the Cheesecake Factory at the Forum Shops at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandi and her men are coming with us as we head back toward the east with a destination of the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>The next journal is about that.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
So, how well did you do at the tables in LasVegas? We have driven by but never stayed.  Have been in Laughlin a couple of times but that was years ago--as you said, other then casinos why would you go there?  Does sound as it you are having a marvelous time.   The Grand Canyon is amazing--don't know if you have been  there before.  The North Rim is incredible!  Travel Safe!!</p>
