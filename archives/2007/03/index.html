<h2>March 25, 2007</h2>


<h3 id="a000109">Grand Canyon</h3>

<p><img height="180" alt="IMG_4551_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4551_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />We left the opulence of Las Vegas&nbsp;the morning of Friday March 16th and headed back through Laughlin to Kingman and finally to Williams, AZ.&nbsp; Mandi &amp; Quincy had rented a car and they travelled the road over Hoover Dam and from there to Williams.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t take the trailer that way, as we were advised that there were severe restrictions, since 911, on vehicles crossing the dam.&nbsp; Apparently, every truck and RV&nbsp;is inspected and could be turned back.&nbsp; Part of the restrictions are also because of the construction taking place&nbsp;for a new bridge being built over the gorge.</p>
<p>The five of us spent the day of the 17th at the canyon.&nbsp; It is only about an hour drive from Williams to the south rim of the canyon.&nbsp; I think the best way to express the overpowering grandure is through pictures, which in no way can give the true sense of size and power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 398px; HEIGHT: 286px" height="213" alt="DSC_2550" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2550_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="DSC_2567" hspace="14" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2567_small.jpg" width="159" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="DSC_2570_edited" hspace="14" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2570_edited_small.jpg" width="159" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="213" alt="DSC_2556" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2556_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The use of a long telephoto lens allowed us to&nbsp;capture some of the greenery along the river at the bottom of the canyon.&nbsp; If you look carefully at the right you can discern a foot bridge spanning the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;While standing here, we also saw&nbsp;bright coloured rafts running the river.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_4559_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4559_edited_small1.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />A few facts about the Grand Canyon:</p>
<p>&ndash; about 277 miles (446 km) along the river</p>
<p>&ndash; an average of 10 miles (16 )km wide</p>
<p>&ndash; 7000 ft elevation at the South Rim and 8,000 ft at the north rim.</p>
<p>&ndash; the rims are about 5,000 ft above the water.</p>
<p>&ndash; rocks in the canyon are hundreds of millions of years old but the canyon itself has an estimated age of six million years or less.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 286px; HEIGHT: 199px" height="240" alt="IMG_4567_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4567_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On our return to Williams,&nbsp;once again we were &nbsp;treated to a wonderful sunset.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4573_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4573_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />One more picture &ndash;&nbsp;since I have given updates on our Ricardo since he was born almost 18 months ago.</p>
<p>He really has grown and is talking up a storm.&nbsp; He is constant motion and gives the most wonderful hugs.&nbsp; We miss him.</p>
<p>We said goodbye to Mandi, Quincy &amp; Ricky the morning of March 18th.&nbsp; They headed south to Tucson for a visit with Aunt Joan before&nbsp;flying back to the Bahamas on the 21st.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>We started our journey home and will be back in Canada by March 31st with a stop at the Hitchhiker factory in Chanute, Kansas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll send you our final journal for this winter in a couple of days.</p>

<h2>March 20, 2007</h2>


<h3 id="a000107">From Tucson to Las Vegas</h3>

<p>We left the casino, south of Tucson, on Saturday morning March 10th.&nbsp; We met my sister Joan on our way through Tucson, as we had left a couple of bags of Texas grapefruit at her place before we went into Mexico.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t bring citrus into the U.S. even if it is U.S. citrus that you are returning with.&nbsp; The Texas grapefruit is so good we didn&rsquo;t want to take a chance that we would lose it.&nbsp; We then stopped in Phoenix overnight before continuing on to Laughlin, Nevada.<img height="210" alt="IMG_4486_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4486_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We followed US 60 then 93 that runs on an angle from Phoenix to Kingman. It is a desolate road after you pass Wickenberg.&nbsp; The land is again dry and there are huge hills with long quite steep grades and deep river valleys.&nbsp; At one point we drove through a very extensive Joshua Tree forest.&nbsp; <br clear="left"><img height="204" alt="IMG_4494_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4494_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were also long valleys as we neared Kingman, AZ.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_4498_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4498_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>From Kingman we went straight west to Laughlin which is on the Colorado River.&nbsp; The road as you go down to the river is a 14 mile hill with a steady 6% grade.&nbsp; Going out the other side to Las Vegas is about a 17 mile uphill pull with about the same grade but at least it does have a few flatter sections.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good thing there is gambling in Laughlin &ndash; there sure isn&rsquo;t any obvious other value to the land in the area.<br clear="left"><img height="228" alt="IMG_4506_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4506_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We arrived in Las Vegas on March 13th and set up at the Circus Circus RV Park, on the north end of the strip.&nbsp; We picked up Mandi, Quincy and Ricardo at the airport that evening.&nbsp; Barn &amp; Shell, as well as Barn&rsquo;s mom and grandmother, were already in Vegas, .&nbsp; The next couple of days we spent&nbsp;being overpowered by the opulence and extravagance of the buildings, decor and&nbsp;facilities. One example is this picture of the hotel complex New York New York!&nbsp; All the buildings are 12 guest towers &ndash; just one hotel.&nbsp; The Statue of Liberty is a faithful copy which rises from a pool of water with a tub-boat and gushing fountains.&nbsp; If you look carefully, you&rsquo;ll see the red roller coaster track through the middle of the resort.&nbsp;<br clear="right"></p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4510_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4510_edited_small.jpg" width="193" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /> 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MGM Lion, weighing some 100,000 lbs,&nbsp;stands 40 to 45 feet high in front of the MGM Grand Hotel.&nbsp; This hotel complex covers over 114 acres, with 5,000 rooms and a 170,000 sq. ft. casino (the size of 4 football fields)<br clear="left">
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4513" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4513_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The old downtown Las Vegas has been revitalised with &ldquo;The Freemont Street Experience, which is a show of 2 million lights on the canopy covering 4 blocks of the street.</p>
<p>The Casinos in the downtown are much smaller, older and less impressive than on the strip, but they still retain the feel of the old Las Vegas.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4523" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4523_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp; <br clear="right">These singing Gondoliers are inside the Venetian Hotel &amp; Casino.&nbsp; The canal winds throughout the hotel and is probably 750 to 1000 feet in length.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t even at ground level.</p>
<p>Barn&rsquo;s grandmother (she is from England and it was her first visit) wondered how she was going to make her friends at home believe that&nbsp;she had had a gondola ride on a Venetian canal, built on the second floor, inside a hotel which itself is built in the desert.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4536_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4536_edited_small.jpg" width="191" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 272px; HEIGHT: 215px" height="240" alt="IMG_4540_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4540_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Las Vegas at night is lights!&nbsp; The Eiffel Tower at the Paris Casino is&nbsp;50 stories high&nbsp;and the dancing waters in Bellagio&rsquo;s 11 acre lake&nbsp;are mesmerizing.&nbsp; Everyone should go to Vegas at least once in their life.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t need to gamble a nickel to enjoy this spectacle in the desert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We left Las Vegas on&nbsp;Friday March 16th having said goodbye to&nbsp;Barn and Shell and family&nbsp;at a great dinner the night before at the Cheesecake Factory at the Forum Shops at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandi and her men are coming with us as we head back toward the east with a destination of the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>The next journal is about that.</p>

<h2>March 15, 2007</h2>


<h3 id="a000106">Mexico - Part II</h3>

<p>We left San Carlos on Sunday morning, March 4th, and retraced our step back north to Hermosillo. It is a large city of about 1 million people.&nbsp; As we needed to pick up a few items before heading west to the coast, we stopped at a WalMart on the west side of the city.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 320px; HEIGHT: 186px" height="175" alt="IMG_4470_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4470_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The road to Bahia Kino ( pronounced Bah-HEE-ah KEY-no) is flat and generally straight with possibly 4 or 5 gentle curves.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp;goes through some excellent agricultural land&nbsp;as well as groves of oranges and large&nbsp;pecan orchards.&nbsp; The road itself is obviously new and therefore has very wide shoulders that you pull&nbsp;&nbsp;onto, to allow other vehicles to pass. </p>
<p><br clear="left"><img height="180" alt="IMG_4456_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4456_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />There are two distinct parts to Kino Bay, the old town and Bahia Nuevo, the new area.&nbsp; The new area is mainly non-Mexican with quite modern houses lining the beach.&nbsp; The residents in that area come into the old town to do their shopping.&nbsp; There are a couple of RV parks out there but we decided that we would rather be in the old part of town and stayed at a small park. This picture is taken from the wharf looking back at the beach in front of the park.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We have seldom been greeted so warmly as we were at Islandia Park, and that is saying something since this lifestyle is so friendly.&nbsp; We were immediately invited to join in happy hour and a couple of nights later were included with everyone when they&nbsp;went to a local restaurant for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to &ldquo;the potato man&rdquo; &ndash; a restaurant that serves the biggest baked potatoes we have ever seen.&nbsp; We were advised that we would probably not be able to eat it all.&nbsp; They had to be 6&ndash;7 inches long and 2 inches in diameter and were stuffed with butter, cheese and pulled beef.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ordered one between us and 2 tacos and that was all that we needed.&nbsp; The bill was 440 pesos &ndash; $4.40 U.S. </p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 477px; HEIGHT: 335px" height="262" alt="IMG_4455_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4455_edited_small1.jpg" width="400" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Bahia Kino is a working fishing village and in the evening we counted at least 100 boats, returned for the night,&nbsp;on the beach.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t pull them up, they just run the engines full out and aim at the beach, tilting the motors just before they run into the sand.&nbsp; The boats skid up on the beach far enough to be out of the water.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_2513_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2513_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We walked the beach at sundown and were treated to some beautiful sunsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We felt in Bahia Kino that we were actually more in the real Mexico than we have been before.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="214" alt="IMG_4474_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4474_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We left Kino Bay on Friday March 9th and once again headed back through Hermosillo on our way to the border at Nogales.&nbsp; The road travels through large areas of grassland and evidence of &nbsp;fire, particularly beside the the road, was common.&nbsp; For miles and miles, there are bulldozed fire break roads on each side of the fence.&nbsp; In a number of areas, the telephone poles beside the road are wrapped in metal up 6 to 8 feet and we can only guess that was to protect them from the fire.</p>
<p>The northbound side of&nbsp; Mex 15 is a much better road than the southbound.&nbsp; It has much wider shoulders and seems to be newer.&nbsp; Our guess is that southbound was the original 2 lane road.&nbsp; Anyway, the drive didn&rsquo;t seem nearly as long coming back north.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;arrived back&nbsp;in the U.S. with little problem and decided to stop for the night at the Diamond Desert Casino south of Tucson.&nbsp; We did some shopping as we had reduced our food supplies, because of US Customs regulations, to cross the border.</p>
<p>The next segment of the journey was to Las Vegas where we had a family reunion with&nbsp;our girls and their men.</p>
<p>Till then</p>

<h2>March 10, 2007</h2>


<h3 id="a000105">Mexico - Part I</h3>

<p>Sunday, Feb 25th we headed south from Tucson to cross the border at Nogales.&nbsp; First of course we had to stop and purchase automobile insurance.&nbsp; Your U.S. or Canadian insurance does not cover you in Mexico.&nbsp; It is reasonably expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; It cost us $286.35 U.S. for 14 days of liability coverage on the truck and trailer and collision&nbsp; on the truck.&nbsp; The agent told us that once you reach 35 days it is cheaper to purchase an annual policy.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4395_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4395_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Once again, there was no personal inspection or stop going into Mexico, although 21 km down the road&nbsp;we needed to stop to obtain a visitors visa which costs about $24 U.S. each.. 
<p>The landscape here is very similar to southern Arizona, with desert shrubs and huge piles of rock erupting from the earth.&nbsp; We passed some very large greenhouse complexes that appeared to be hydroponic agriculture.&nbsp; They were set right in the middle of barren desert and certainly would get all the sun that they need.<br clear="left">
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4392_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4392_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /> 
<p>We stopped in Santa Ana for an excellent lunch at a roadside stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was our first chance to see up close (and while not moving) some of the houses that had&nbsp;been visible as we drove along.&nbsp; We were amazed at the housing in so much of the area that we visited.&nbsp; &nbsp;Shelter&nbsp;is made of anything; plywood, canvas, tin sheets,corrugated metal, cardboard &ndash; anything available.&nbsp; However, no matter how rudimentary the house, there was&nbsp;most&nbsp;often a line of clean wash hanging out.&nbsp; Even in such a basic shelter as the one in this picture, there is occasionally an air conditioner.&nbsp; You can see it through the wall on the right hand side.&nbsp; It gets very, very hot in the summer.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="237" alt="IMG_4437_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4437_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We arrived in San Carlos late in the afternoon,&nbsp;after a very long drive which took us along the edge of Hermosillo and then about 90 miles further south to just north west&nbsp;of Guaymas &ndash; a total of 330 miles from the campground in Tucson.&nbsp; The highway is 4 lane all the way, however as you go through the villages and towns speed is reduced.&nbsp; Not just reduced, almost stopped.&nbsp; They control the speed by &ldquo;topes&rdquo; (speed bumps) and they are so severe that you need to drop to a crawl not to damage your vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the open highway there are no &ldquo;topes&rdquo; but there is also no shoulder to the road and the drop off from the pavement can be anywhere from 2 inches to 2 feet.&nbsp; There are signs warning of the sharp edge but as would be expected, they are in Spanish.&nbsp; Our Spanish/English dictionary got a good workout figuring out the&nbsp;traffic signs.</p>
<p>The road is in good repair and very busy.&nbsp; It is the main highway down the west side of Mexico and is well travelled by 18 wheelers and intercity buses.&nbsp; There are pull offs quite often, however again the pavement drops down 4 to 10 inches at them, so we didn&rsquo;t even attempt to take a break there with the trailer behind us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were glad to arrive.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_2462_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2462_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>San Carlos is&nbsp;located on a bay in the Sea of Cortez and we stayed&nbsp;at a park quite close to the older area of&nbsp; town.&nbsp; We walked in to the grocery store and to the fruit &amp; vegetable stand.&nbsp; One day we drove to the end of the road and the viewpoint out over the Sea of Cortez.&nbsp; Looking back&nbsp;from the viewpoint you could see the mountain that overlooks the town and was so obvious as we arrived.&nbsp; These are big hills &ndash; that is a dirt road at the bottom left, on the closest hill in the picture.<br clear="right"><img height="213" alt="DSC_2474_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2474_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We went in to Guaymas on Thursday.&nbsp; It is a city of more than 125,000 and is an old port, now a fishing centre.&nbsp; It also is a departure point for one of the ferries across the Sea of Cortez to the Baja.&nbsp; There is a central square and a central market.&nbsp; We ended up at Ley&rsquo;s, which is a large Mexican supermarket chain and has excellent selection.&nbsp; In driving through parts of the city, we saw&nbsp;extreme poverty and also quite lavish homes.&nbsp; This seems to be an area of great contrasts.<br clear="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_2478_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2478_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />On Friday we visited a Pearl Farm operation.&nbsp; This is the only pearl farm in the Sea of Cortez.&nbsp; The oysters that are used are only found in this one area of the world.&nbsp; The farm was started by 3 University students as&nbsp;an experiment for their Master&rsquo;s degree thesis.&nbsp; It turned out to be successful and they now operate it commercially. They produce beautifully coloured pearls &ndash;&nbsp;blues, greens, grays, pinks&nbsp;and also half pearls in the same colours.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;a great free tour and one I would recommend to&nbsp;everyone.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>That afternoon we went golfing at the course in San Carlos.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t have great scores but did enjoy ourselves.&nbsp; In the evening we went for dinner with some new acquaintances, Bob and Joann.&nbsp; The restaurant is a teaching facility and when we ordered Caesar Salad, we were treated to approximately a 15 minute preparation done step by step right at our table.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that Caesar Salad was invented in Mexico? We didn&rsquo;t know that either.</p>
<p><img height="237" alt="IMG_4440_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4440_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We enjoyed our time in San Carlos and would certainly go back there again.&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was wonderful &ndash;&nbsp;about 80 to 85 F during the day with only about 15% humidity and at&nbsp;night&nbsp;you really did need a sweater&nbsp;or light jacket.</p>
<p>There were good restaurants, the golf course and Guaymas only 20 Km away.</p>
<p>But, it still really isn&rsquo;t the Mexico that we thought we might find this far south of the U.S. border.&nbsp; I guess the west coast of Mexico on the Sea of Cortez has had so much tourism that it is bound to feel Americanised.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On Sunday,&nbsp;March 4th, we headed north and then west again to Bahia de&nbsp;Keno, also on the Sea of Cortez.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let you know what we found there in the next journal.</p>
<p>Till then</p>
