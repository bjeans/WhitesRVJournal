<h3>Mexico - Part II</h3>

<p>We left San Carlos on Sunday morning, March 4th, and retraced our step back north to Hermosillo. It is a large city of about 1 million people.&nbsp; As we needed to pick up a few items before heading west to the coast, we stopped at a WalMart on the west side of the city.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 320px; HEIGHT: 186px" height="175" alt="IMG_4470_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4470_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The road to Bahia Kino ( pronounced Bah-HEE-ah KEY-no) is flat and generally straight with possibly 4 or 5 gentle curves.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp;goes through some excellent agricultural land&nbsp;as well as groves of oranges and large&nbsp;pecan orchards.&nbsp; The road itself is obviously new and therefore has very wide shoulders that you pull&nbsp;&nbsp;onto, to allow other vehicles to pass. </p>
<p><br clear="left"><img height="180" alt="IMG_4456_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4456_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />There are two distinct parts to Kino Bay, the old town and Bahia Nuevo, the new area.&nbsp; The new area is mainly non-Mexican with quite modern houses lining the beach.&nbsp; The residents in that area come into the old town to do their shopping.&nbsp; There are a couple of RV parks out there but we decided that we would rather be in the old part of town and stayed at a small park. This picture is taken from the wharf looking back at the beach in front of the park.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We have seldom been greeted so warmly as we were at Islandia Park, and that is saying something since this lifestyle is so friendly.&nbsp; We were immediately invited to join in happy hour and a couple of nights later were included with everyone when they&nbsp;went to a local restaurant for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to &ldquo;the potato man&rdquo; &ndash; a restaurant that serves the biggest baked potatoes we have ever seen.&nbsp; We were advised that we would probably not be able to eat it all.&nbsp; They had to be 6&ndash;7 inches long and 2 inches in diameter and were stuffed with butter, cheese and pulled beef.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ordered one between us and 2 tacos and that was all that we needed.&nbsp; The bill was 440 pesos &ndash; $4.40 U.S. </p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 477px; HEIGHT: 335px" height="262" alt="IMG_4455_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4455_edited_small1.jpg" width="400" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Bahia Kino is a working fishing village and in the evening we counted at least 100 boats, returned for the night,&nbsp;on the beach.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t pull them up, they just run the engines full out and aim at the beach, tilting the motors just before they run into the sand.&nbsp; The boats skid up on the beach far enough to be out of the water.</p>
<p><img height="213" alt="DSC_2513_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_2513_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We walked the beach at sundown and were treated to some beautiful sunsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We felt in Bahia Kino that we were actually more in the real Mexico than we have been before.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="214" alt="IMG_4474_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4474_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We left Kino Bay on Friday March 9th and once again headed back through Hermosillo on our way to the border at Nogales.&nbsp; The road travels through large areas of grassland and evidence of &nbsp;fire, particularly beside the the road, was common.&nbsp; For miles and miles, there are bulldozed fire break roads on each side of the fence.&nbsp; In a number of areas, the telephone poles beside the road are wrapped in metal up 6 to 8 feet and we can only guess that was to protect them from the fire.</p>
<p>The northbound side of&nbsp; Mex 15 is a much better road than the southbound.&nbsp; It has much wider shoulders and seems to be newer.&nbsp; Our guess is that southbound was the original 2 lane road.&nbsp; Anyway, the drive didn&rsquo;t seem nearly as long coming back north.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;arrived back&nbsp;in the U.S. with little problem and decided to stop for the night at the Diamond Desert Casino south of Tucson.&nbsp; We did some shopping as we had reduced our food supplies, because of US Customs regulations, to cross the border.</p>
<p>The next segment of the journey was to Las Vegas where we had a family reunion with&nbsp;our girls and their men.</p>
<p>Till then</p>
