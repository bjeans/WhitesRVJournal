<h3 id="a000132">Thailand Part II - Bangkok</h3>

<p>Going from China to other south-east Asian countries is like going from Ontario to PEI, the size difference is huge.&nbsp; Our flight between Chiang Mai and Bangkok took only 70 minutes.&nbsp; Thailand, just slightly larger than Manitoba, is one of&nbsp; the first foreign countries I can remember learning about.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then&nbsp;called Siam and Yul Brenner and Debra Kerr were starring in the King and I.&nbsp; Today 60+ million people live there and everyone we met was courteous, gentle, helpful and personable.&nbsp; &nbsp;The consultant Cambridge Travel uses, said it was her favourite country out of about 80 she has visited. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>As in each previously visited city, our day began with a city tour. Thailand has over 25,000 temples (called Wats) so every tour includes 2 or 3 of their best.&nbsp; The first, Wat Trimitr (Temple of the Golden Buddha), was just what its name implied.&nbsp; Five and a half TONS of SOLID GOLD, set in a beautiful park-like setting near the city centre. It was discovered, beneath a layer of stucco, while the temple was under re-construction. <br clear="left"></p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>The next stop was Wat Po (Temple of the Reclining Buddha). The statue is about 15 metres (45 feet) long and is painted with 24 karat gold. </p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>It was interesting to see the monks, all of whom wear a bright orange toga, sitting having breakfast beside the temple. <br clear="left"><img height="197" alt="P1010021E" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010021E_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p><br />
<p>It the afternoon we enjoyed a cruise on the Chao Phraya River through the middle of Bangkok. It functions almost like another expressway, with boats of all types, both freight and passenger, coming and going constantly.</p><br />
<p><img height="236" alt="IMG_5493_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5493_edited_small1.jpg" width="315" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="P1010051E" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010051E_small.jpg" width="192" vspace="4" border="2" /></p><br />
<p>Many commercial establishments are accessed from the river frontage and people live in homes&nbsp;built right on&nbsp;the river, including the White House. </p><br />
<p><img height="240" alt="P1010065E_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010065E_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Part way through the trip we were transferred to a rice barge for a mid-afternoon lunch. These boats were originally used to transport rice but have been converted for tourist service.&nbsp; We stopped in mid river and were given bags of bread crumbs which attracted hundreds of big cat fish (18-24&rdquo;) when we threw the crumbs overboard. &nbsp;The water boiled with the frenzy of the fish to feed. &nbsp;When we tried again a&nbsp;hundred metres downstream &ndash;&nbsp;there were no fish. </p><br />
<p>During this part of our trip, meals were not included, so we set out downtown for dinners and found a couple of great places with excellent food.&nbsp; The temperatures were in the very humid 30s which we found almost overpowering at times.&nbsp; Many establishments are not air conditioned. </p><br />
<p>An all day trip, to the famous Bridge on the River Kwai, meant an eary start the following day. &nbsp;Please join us there.</p><br />
