<h2>January 23, 2007</h2>


<h3 id="a000095">Into the Winter of 2006/07</h3>

<p>Well everyone, we are back on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, we left southern Ontario on the 2nd of December and are now in Texas &ndash; at a campground in Mission in the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
<p>We had a good two months at home visiting with friends and family but November wasn&rsquo;t the nicest month so we were happy to be on the road to warmer weather.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, from what we hear, December really wasn&rsquo;t winter at home.&nbsp; Oh well!</p>
<p>We crossed at Buffalo and were pulled over by U.S. Customs to check what food we were bringing in.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t have a problem as we had carefully read the U.S. restrictions and had none of the prohibited items &ndash; i.e.&nbsp;beef products, certain fruits or vegetables, etc. We got as far as State College, PA that night and stayed in a WalMart parking lot as&nbsp;few campgrounds are open that far north,&nbsp;at that time of year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following day we travelled just over 200 km to Gettysburg, PA arriving there before noon.&nbsp; We immediately headed to the Visitors Center and museum for the Civil War&rsquo;s Gettysburg Battlefield &ndash; the most visited, most written about and the most intensely studied battle ever recorded.&nbsp; Of the 165,000 who fought there July 1 to 3, 1863, there were around 50,000 casualties.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4142" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4142_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We walked through the National Cemetery, and stood on the site where&nbsp;Lincoln gave his&nbsp;famous Gettysburg address&nbsp;at the&nbsp;dedication of the site&nbsp;to the fallen Union soldiers.</p>
<p>There are over 1,400 monuments and cannon along 40 miles of roads in Gettysburg National Monument .&nbsp; These monuments have been erected by the states, towns, and particularly by the various branches of the armies that fought and/or sent soldiers there.&nbsp;&nbsp; We drove the Auto Route through the battlefield, stopping at many of the monuments, where at most of them, makers describe significant action during those three days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The following morning, we visited President Eisenhower&rsquo;s farm where, after leaving the White House, he lived with his wife, Mamie.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>Our next stop was in Wilson, NC.&nbsp; We stayed there while visiting a cousin in Greenville.&nbsp; We left the trailer in the campground there for 13 days,&nbsp;as we figured we were far enough south that it wouldn&rsquo;t freeze.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="234" alt="IMG_4150_closeup_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4150_closeup_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We&nbsp;flew to Nassau in the&nbsp;Bahamas and then on to the island of San Salvador where Mandi lives.&nbsp; This is the first time that Ross has been to San Sal, so it was great for him to meet and re-meet Quincy&rsquo;s family&nbsp;(some of them came to Canada for the wedding).&nbsp; The island has wonderful sand beaches, great diving, inland lakes and the weather was wonderfully warm.&nbsp; Best of all we spent time with our family.&nbsp;Ricky has changed so much since they were home at Thanksgiving &ndash;&nbsp;he&rsquo;s starting to be a little boy not a baby any more.<br clear="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few pictures from the island &ndash; the 64 square mile island that was Christopher Columbus&rsquo;s first land fall on his first trip to the new world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="242" alt="IMG_2562" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2562_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="8" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_2620" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2620_small.jpg" width="180" vspace="8" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="225" alt="IMG_2630" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2630_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="8" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_2662" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2662_small.jpg" width="180" vspace="8" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="169" alt="IMG_2684" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_2684_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Mandi &amp; Quincy have built a double house and furnished the second side (which is where we stayed)&nbsp;so that they can rent it to island visitors.&nbsp; They have already had a number of guests stay there &ndash;&nbsp;anywhere from 5 days to two months.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;laid back island&nbsp;with tourism as its main industry &ndash;&nbsp;but you are hard pressed to find touristy spots.&nbsp; Other than the Club Med there are no big resorts and the dining out is either there or at local restaurants (which we enjoyed totally).&nbsp;&nbsp; The island is small &ndash; about 14 miles long by 7 miles wide and the centre is all lakes so the road goes all the way around.&nbsp; As Mandi is the bank manager on the island and Quincy has lived there all his life, we were immediately welcomed by everyone. A very friendly place.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in visiting San Salvador, Mandi would be delighted to have them stay at their guest house &ndash; her email address is <a href="mailto:mandi40@hotmail.com">mandi40@hotmail.com</a> .&nbsp; You can learn more about San Sal by going on to <a href="http://www.bahamas.com/">www.Bahamas.com</a>&nbsp; then click on &ldquo;Islands&rdquo; and then &ldquo;San Salvador&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mandi says that she would love to have visitors and will give preference to anyone&nbsp;receiving this journal.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Bowl2" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/bowl2_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We flew back to Raleigh, NC&nbsp; on the 20th and made a bee line to Birmingham, AL to get to my nephew Paul&rsquo;s by lunch on Dec 22.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a&nbsp;grand nephew, Jack,&nbsp;that we had not seen, who was born in May .&nbsp; Another&nbsp;great addition to the family and he is just as cute as this picture shows.&nbsp;Paul and Jill seem to have a keeper!</p>
<p>After lunch we headed west on our way to Dallas, TX.</p>
<p>Two days later, we pulled into&nbsp;Trader&rsquo;s Village campground and settled in for the Christmas break.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be back again in a couple of days to complete the trip to Mission, TX</p>
<p>&lsquo;Til then</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>
