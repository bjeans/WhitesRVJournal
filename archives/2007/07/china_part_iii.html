<h3>China  Part III - The Yangtze River</h3>

<p>Our plane arrived in Yichang in mid afternoon and we immediately boarded a mini bus for our trip to&nbsp;board the ship for our Yangtze cruise.&nbsp; It was about a 2 hour trip, in pouring rain from the airport to the dock.&nbsp; We stopped for dinner on the way and also stopped at a convenience store to stock up on snacks and&nbsp;drinks for the cruise.&nbsp; As we neared the river we left the fertile plains and climbed&nbsp;through mountains.&nbsp; It was a challenge manuvering our luggage, down the steep stairs on the side of a cliff, in the dark, in&nbsp;pouring rain, to the deck of the ship &ndash;&nbsp;but we all made it with no mishaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 314px; HEIGHT: 209px" height="216" alt="IMG_4871_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4871_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />The Yangtze, which is the third biggest river in the world,&nbsp; meanders over 6,300 kilometers from its source to its estuary.&nbsp; The plains downstream from Yichang&nbsp;have been&nbsp;subject to massive flooding&nbsp;with flood levels 6 &ndash; 17 meters higher than normal.</p>
<p>Close to Yichang, the Three Gorges Project is in the final stages of development.&nbsp; It is a massive dam, which when completed will provide flood control for 1,530,000 hectares (3,780,600 acres) of rich farm lands in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river.&nbsp; It will also have a total generating&nbsp;capacity of 18,200 Megawatts, which is enough&nbsp;power to replace 40 to 50 million tons of raw coal combustion each year.&nbsp; As a comparison, the Grand Coulee on the Columbia River has an installed capacity of only 10,830 MW.&nbsp; Further, it&nbsp;will improve navigation capacity on the 660 km long waterway from Yichang City to Chongqing&nbsp; from 10 to 50 million tons as well as improve navigation below the dam in the dry season.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="238" alt="IMG_4874_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4874_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />In the morning, the sun was out and we sailed upstream through 4 locks that are located beside the dam.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dual-channel five-step ship lock and also a one step vertical ship lift (under construction) As the water above the dam has not yet reached its maximum height, the fifth lock was not used by us.&nbsp; By&nbsp;now we were in the first -Xiling Gorge, 76 km long&nbsp;&ndash; of the Three Gorges. <br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_4875_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4875_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The mountains were right beside us, rugged, steep and mainly tree covered.&nbsp; Even with this difficult terrain, the edges close to the river were cultivated in steeply terraced fields.&nbsp; A roadway runs along the river, through many tunnels and over many bridges.&nbsp; However, the river&nbsp;remains the major transportation route.</p>
<p><br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 360px; HEIGHT: 227px" height="194" alt="IMG_4890_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4890_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />The normal river level, on completion, will be at 175 meters but was at about 150 meters as we sailed.&nbsp; There have been massive relocations of cities&nbsp;that would be covered by the water.&nbsp; New cities&nbsp;were built (this is one) above the new water line and the old cities have been demolished.&nbsp; The rubble was removed&nbsp;so it would not contaminate the water&nbsp;covering the old sites.&nbsp; About 1,136,000 million people have or will be resettled.&nbsp; Can you imagine the logistics to a project of that magnitude!<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 224px; HEIGHT: 285px" height="240" alt="IMG_4918_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4918_edited_small.jpg" width="180" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 351px; HEIGHT: 271px" height="240" alt="IMG_4940_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4940_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Early in the morning on day&nbsp;2 of the cruise we&nbsp;took a smaller boat to&nbsp;travel&nbsp;up the scenic Shennong Stream and through&nbsp;its gorges.&nbsp; At the upper reaches we transfered to a flat bottomed wooden&nbsp;boat that was paddled by 8 very fit men.&nbsp; When the stream became too shallow, we were pulled upstream by the &ldquo;trackers&rdquo; on the riverbank.<img height="249" alt="IMG_4948_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4948_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>All along the river we have seen evidence of coal mining.&nbsp; These huge bunkers are built into the side of the mountain and the coal barges are loaded by gravity feed from them.&nbsp; With the majority of the electricity for the country&nbsp;generated by coal plants we understand the demand.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 228px; HEIGHT: 279px" height="240" alt="IMG_4951_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4951_edited_small1.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />This view of&nbsp; the&nbsp;8 km long&nbsp;third Gorge &ndash; WuXia &ndash; which we had just come through, was taken from&nbsp;White Emperor City.&nbsp; &nbsp;We climbed several hundred steps up Baidi Mountain to reach this complex which is&nbsp;almost 2,000 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the level of the river has been raised so much, the White Emperor City is now on an island.</p>
<p>Along the sides of the steps as we went up were vendors, all wanting us to buy their product.&nbsp; The&nbsp;English they spoke related only to&nbsp;&nbsp;their sales and we don&rsquo;t think they really understood those words&nbsp;either.&nbsp; As we passed by they called out &ldquo;&nbsp;Lady, lady, maybe later&rdquo;.&nbsp; Not really a very good sales pitch!<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 207px; HEIGHT: 311px" height="240" alt="IMG_4964_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4964_edited_small1.jpg" width="135" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 315px; HEIGHT: 365px" height="240" alt="P1000468" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000468_small.jpg" width="186" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>On our 3rd day on the river we visited Ghost City, where it is said that people checked in after their death.&nbsp; Many statues of ghosts and monsters bearing ferocious expressions and exaggerated poses are set throughout the buildings.&nbsp; One of the streets has many vendors and is called &ldquo;The Market of the Nether World Street&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a sign posted that set out the conduct expected of the vendors.&nbsp; We particularly liked the 4th rule&nbsp; -&ldquo;No terrifying visitors to consume&rdquo;.&nbsp; We found English signage in all of the tourist areas, but they do certainly have a way with words.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 366px; HEIGHT: 286px" height="235" alt="IMG_4993_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4993_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;As we continued up the river that misty afternoon, the mountains receded&nbsp;and fertile fields took their place along the river.&nbsp; There was a lot of river traffic servicing the shoreline.<br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_5005" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5005_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;We arrived in Chongqing after dark and were intrigued by the light show from the buildings along the harbour.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shoreline was lined by brilliantly lit party boats and floating restaurants.&nbsp; At about 10 pm the boats shut off their lights and the buildings quickly followed suit.&nbsp; What a&nbsp; spectacular welcome at the end of our cruise.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>We stayed on board that night and after breakfast the next morning, we disembarked for the next leg of our journey.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re headed to the grotto carvings and the pandas.</p>
<p>Till then</p>
