<h3>China Part V - Xian </h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_5083_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5083_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />Our flight to the&nbsp;north east from Chongqing to Xi&rsquo;an crossed the Qinling Mountains.&nbsp; The Yellow River flows to the north of the mountains and the Yangtze to the south.</p>
<p>The mountains, from the air, appear to have no foothills.&nbsp; The Guanzhong Plain starts immediately and is very fertile and totally cultivated.&nbsp; Villages, towns and small cities are scattered everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Xi&rsquo;an, with a population&nbsp;of 8 million&nbsp;was called&nbsp;a <strong><em>small city</em></strong>.<br clear="right"><br clear="right"><img height="450" alt="P1000581" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000581_small1.jpg" width="600" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="333" alt="P1000588" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000588_small1.jpg" width="250" align="left" vspace="5" border="2" />A jigsaw puzzle of immense proportions !</p>
<p>The Terrra Cotta Warriors were accidentally discovered in 1974,&nbsp;by a group of workers who were working on a well.&nbsp; The figures are from the Qin Dynasty from 221 &ndash; 206 B.C.&nbsp; They were created to protect the mausoleum of the emperor and to help rule another empire in the afterlife.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The above&nbsp;picture is Pit #1 covering about 3 1/2 acres, where there are more than 6,000 terra cotta warriors and horses in battle line formations.&nbsp; Close by there are 2 other smaller pits holding another 1,600 plus warriors, horses and chariots. .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figures are&nbsp;life-sized&nbsp; The lower part of the body is solid, the upper hollow and the heads are separate.&nbsp; No two warriors are duplicated.</p>
<p>Huge buildings&nbsp;have been&nbsp;constructed to protect the&nbsp;pits and their contents&nbsp;from the elements while the work continues.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="300" alt="P1000612_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000612_edited_small.jpg" width="400" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;The figures were positioned in underground timber lined vaults but the site was ransacked, vandalized and set fire to, only a few years after the death of the First Emperor.&nbsp; Only one undamaged figure was found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This picture shows one of the areas where archaeologists are unearthing the pieces.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="292" alt="P1000591_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000591_edited_small.jpg" width="500" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>So &ndash; the jigsaw puzzle &ndash; the painstaking work of putting the figures back together, one by one continues.<img height="262" alt="IMG_5131_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5131_edited_small.jpg" width="350" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a familiar scene all over China.</p>
<p>Numerous cranes at building sites and buildings under construction, wrapped in green mesh.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_5164" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5164_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That evening we attended a cultural show with dinner at the Tang Dynasty Restaurant and Theater.&nbsp; The music and dance originated over one thousand years ago.</p>
<p>What a perfect performance to celebrate our fellow traveller, Alice&rsquo;s birthday.<br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 205px; HEIGHT: 270px" height="240" alt="IMG_5187" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5187_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday morning, May 18th, we walked to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, which was quite close to our hotel.</p>
<p>This is one of the most famous Buddhist temples in China.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;built in&nbsp;652 A.D. to&nbsp;preserve the manuscripts of Buddhist texts that were brought from India and subsequently translated into Chinese.</p>
<p>It is very simple, 7 stories high and built of layers of brick, with no cement.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1000635" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000635_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old city of Xi&rsquo;an is surrounded by a well preserved wall reconstructed in the Ming Dynasty.&nbsp; It is certainly wide and very flat, as the city is built on a plain.&nbsp; From this height, the views of the city are much better than from ground level.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>After another excellent lunch (we certainly are being fed well), we headed to the airport for our afternoon flight to Beijing.</p>

<p>Can you imagine how long it took when this was done to  make the terra cotta warriors?  How incredible! Such sights you have seen.  As I said before I think you should put all of this in a book and publish it.  For those of us who will never get there it would be such a journey!  Keep sending your journals.  Sincerely, Bette</p>
