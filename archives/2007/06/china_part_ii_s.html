<h3>China   Part II - Suzhou</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 258px; HEIGHT: 257px" height="240" alt="IMG_4777_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4777_edited_small1.jpg" width="237" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 209px; HEIGHT: 256px" height="240" alt="IMG_4786_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4786_edited_small1.jpg" width="180" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Suzhou, about 50 miles west of Shanghai,&nbsp;is situated on the lower Yangtze River on the shores of Lake Taihu and is renowned for its beautiful stone bridges, pagodas, canals&nbsp;and carefully designed gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a very modern city with new highrise apartments everywhere,&nbsp;many many close to the New Development Zone.&nbsp; This planned industrial area is now home to close to 100 major foreign enterprises &ndash; names like Dupont, Nike, Nabisco, Sanyo, Sony, Danone, Samsung, Shell and Mitsubishi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 328px; HEIGHT: 249px" height="240" alt="IMG_4774_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4774_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We visited Golden Rooster Lakeside, which is a beautifully groomed park across the lake from the industrial park.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There were&nbsp;many very interesting sculptures &ndash; this one of a group of children wading though the rice paddies. Music wafted gently in the air, from speakers hidden in bushes or disguised as rocks.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4782_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4782_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Suzhou has been proclaimed a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its 2,000 year-old gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp; We visited the classic Chinese garden &ndash; the Master&rsquo;s Nets Garden.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have wonderfully descriptive names for their gardens&nbsp;which were built long ago.&nbsp; Examples are:&nbsp;Humble Administrator&rsquo;s Garden &ndash; 1509&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lion Grove Garden &ndash; 1342&rdquo;, &ldquo;Surging Wave Pavilion&ndash; 1044&rdquo; and &ldquo;Garden to Linger In &ndash; 1522.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="IMG_4804_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4804_edited_small1.jpg" width="180" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 301px; HEIGHT: 226px" height="240" alt="IMG_4810_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4810_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;After lunch we took a cruise along The Grand Canal and also&nbsp;through some of the spider web of picturesque canals in the city.&nbsp; Now we know why Suzhou is called&nbsp; &ldquo; the Venice of the Orient&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4787_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4787_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />The Grand Canal, at 1,800 kilometers (1,080 miles) is the world&rsquo;s longest man-made waterway.&nbsp; It runs north and south (most of China&rsquo;s rivers flow east and west) and connects the Yangtze River valley and the Yellow River valley.&nbsp; Its building began in 486 B.C. and all parts were finally linked together by about 610 A.D.&nbsp;<br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 186px; HEIGHT: 268px" height="240" alt="IMG_4818_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4818_edited_small.jpg" width="159" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />China has produced silk for at least 6,000 years and Suzhou is considered the silk capital of the country. From the mid 1300s to 1911 most of the high-grade silk produced for the royal families was made by Suzhou silk weavers.&nbsp; After our canal cruise we toured the Silk Embroidery Institute where we watched the production of silk from&nbsp;larva to finished product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cocoons are treated with boiling water to allow the silk filament to be separated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These women attach the filaments (which can be up to&nbsp;1,000 meters in length from a single cocoon) to a&nbsp;bobbin which spins, unravelling the cocoon.&nbsp; Different grades of silk are used for different products, from comforters to fine clothing.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 263px; HEIGHT: 228px" height="271" alt="IMG_4823_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4823_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />The next morning we left the hotel very early, by rickshaw, to visit a public park and then to go to the flower and bird market. These&nbsp;rickshaws are actually three wheeled bicycles and&nbsp;a number&nbsp;of the operators are middle aged men.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t an ounce of excess fat on any of them.</p>
<p>This was a most interesting ride as we shared the road with cars, buses, scooters and bicycles.&nbsp; If you want to get somewhere, you just go.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stop &ndash;&nbsp;just go.&nbsp; Turning left across 6 lanes of traffic was an experience.&nbsp;Fortunately, my hair was already grey.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="246" alt="IMG_4829_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4829_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;There&nbsp; were a number of groups practising Tai Chi in the park, as well as&nbsp;many other exercise and dance groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout China, we found the parks to be used as an interactive social exercise facility.&nbsp; They aren&rsquo;t just grass and trees.&nbsp; Sort of like an outdoor YMCA.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4846" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4846_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we headed back toward our hotel we travelled beside one of the canals and watched the canal cleaners at work.&nbsp; All day they travel the waterways with scoops and nets, removing any leaves or debris that had fallen into the water.&nbsp; Once again, we were impressed with the cleanliness.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_4855_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_4855_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" p <>Before leaving Suzhou we visited&nbsp;The Lion Forest Garden where many of the rocks in the garden resembled Lions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also visited&nbsp;a workshop where beautiful pictures &ndash; landscapes, flowers and&nbsp;animals &ndash; are faithfully reproduced by silk embroidery.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>After an early lunch we headed back toward Shanghai&rsquo;s second airport for our 1:30 flight to Yichang.&nbsp; We had been so busy these first few days that we looked forward to our next segment &ndash; cruising the Yangtze River.</p>
