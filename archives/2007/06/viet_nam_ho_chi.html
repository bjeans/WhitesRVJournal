<h3>Viet Nam  - Ho Chi Minh City - (Saigon)</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 314px; HEIGHT: 227px" height="234" alt="IMG_5698_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5698_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We arrived in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) late in the evening on May 31st and as always were met at the airport by our guide.&nbsp; Our accommodation was at the historic Caravelle Hotel right in the middle of the city.&nbsp; During the 60&rsquo;s the Caravelle was home to the Australian and New Zealand Embassies, the offices for the Associated Press, NBC, CBS, the New York Times and the Washington Post to name a few.&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="VN26" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/VN26_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />Viet Nam has a vibrant feel and is a country of young people. We were told that about 70% of the citizens have been born since the &ldquo;American War&rdquo;.&nbsp; To the majority of citizens the war is only history.</p>
<p>The temperature during the day was about 35C (95F) with high humidity, so it is at night that&nbsp;the City really comes alive. &nbsp;City Hall is impressive the way it is lit up at night.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_5689" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5689_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />During the day, most of the ladies are totally covered up to protect themselves from the sun.&nbsp; Our guide told us that the young women&nbsp;do this to keep their complections as pale as possible.&nbsp; But when the sun goes down, the cover-ups disappear and they, their families&nbsp;and hundreds of&nbsp; other citizens emerge&nbsp;into the streets of the city to eat, visit and play.&nbsp; As we strolled in the evening, we felt totally safe with so many people around.&nbsp;<br clear="left"><img height="225" alt="P1010531" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010531_small3.jpg" width="500" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>This is rush hour in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;first morning we&nbsp;drove about 75 km from the centre of Ho Chi Minh City to the Cu Chi Tunnels &ndash; a strategically important war zone.&nbsp; Originally constructed by the Viet Minh during the war with the French, the tunnels were repaired and expanded in the early 1960s,&nbsp;by the Viet Cong.<img height="267" alt="VN9" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/VN9_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /> </p>
<p>There&nbsp;were about 200 kilometres of tunnels, said to be several stories deep and able to hold up to 10,000 soldiers.&nbsp; There was an&nbsp;underground hospital, kitchen, &nbsp;dining room and command post.&nbsp; As you can see by the picture, the soldiers were small and they literally disappeared before our eyes as they sank into the ground.&nbsp; We also saw some absolutely gruesome booby traps that were used.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_5674_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5674_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;We stopped at a rubber plantation to see how they gathered the secretions from the trees.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways it reminded us of how we gather sap from&nbsp;maple trees to make syrup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viet Nam processes an average of 500,000 tonnes of rubber latex per year &ndash; 80% of which is exported.<br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 494px; HEIGHT: 294px" height="322" alt="IMG_5668_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5668_edited_small2.jpg" width="520" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>As we drove&nbsp;back to Ho Chi Minh&nbsp;City&nbsp;from the tunnels, on a wonderful wide double lane road, we noticed brightly coloured tall&nbsp;narrow buildings &ndash;&nbsp;stores on the bottom and obviously apartments above.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our guide explained that the road had relatively recently been widened.&nbsp; However, to widen it, the thousands of stores and homes that crowded the sides of the original road&nbsp;had to be removed.&nbsp; The government built new stores and apartments for everyone, but only to the width of the ones that were demolished. The individual owners can build&nbsp;higher if they want to and obviously a few have.</p>
<p><img height="235" alt="IMG_5707_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5707_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The following day we visited the Re-unification Palace, on the site of&nbsp;the palace of the French governor and later the presidential palace for South Vietnam.&nbsp; This is the Foreign Dignitaries Reception Hall.&nbsp; It was from the grounds of this building that the final&nbsp;American evacuation&nbsp;from Saigon took place and is the site of the official handover of power during the fall of Saigon on April 30,1975.</p>
<p><br clear="right">Afterwards, at the War Remnants Museum we were able to get a perspective of the war in Viet Nam from the point of view of the people of Viet Nam.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1010501" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010501_small.jpg" width="160" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The afternoon we spent on our own checking out the area around out hotel.&nbsp; Just down the street was a half scale replica of Notre Dame Cathederal &ndash; beautiful &ndash; a reminder of the French occupation of the country. </p>
<p>We stopped to listen to a group of musicians who had set up on the steps of the Opera House.&nbsp; From the quality of their music we expect that they were professionals.&nbsp; They drew a large audiance. </p>
<p>That evening we had dinner at the other historic hotel &ndash; the Rex &ndash; and another stroll around the central square enjoying the cooler evening.</p>
<p>The next morning we headed out to the airport for our flight to&nbsp;Hanoi.</p>
<p>Bernie and Ross&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi folks,  I have been off line for some time and am back.  I do not remember if I told you or not but Bob Carr passed away back in May.  I have not been online since around June so I couldn't remember if I had let you know about his passing.  Seems to me I did but since I am not sure I thought I would let you know now that I am back online.  The pictures and your adventures are absolutely fascinating,  Keep well.<br />

<p>As always your enlightened information on the countries that you travel are so informative and interesting.  I always look forward to hearing of your next venture.  There is nothing but envy here, but it takes a certain mindset to take off and travel as you two have done.  Admiration would come to mind.  Keep well the road.</p>

<p>Awesome as usual.  This is our first chance to see these pictures, as we just got back from a month in Naples, Florida.</p>

<p>Great stuff, Bernice and Ross - we can't wait to see what's next.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />
