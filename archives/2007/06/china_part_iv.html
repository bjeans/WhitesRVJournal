<h3>China  Part IV - Chongqing & Dazu</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_5023_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5023_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />We disembarked our ship, the MV President #1 on Tuesday morning, May 15, in Chongqing.&nbsp; This was the only time that the tour company guide wasn&rsquo;t on hand to meet us.&nbsp; We had to wait about 45 minutes for them to arrive after Judy got in touch&nbsp;to find out where they were.&nbsp; Best thing that could have happened &ndash; they bent over backwards for the next two days to make sure we saw and did everything.&nbsp;We were given all kinds of extras during the tours and at meals.&nbsp; We also had a super guide &ndash; Coco &ndash; who helped to make these two days great.<br clear="right"><img height="237" alt="IMG_5030_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5030_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chongqing is&nbsp;called &ldquo;the mountain city&rdquo; as it is built on hills and surrounded by mountains or&nbsp;&ldquo;the river city&rdquo; as&nbsp;5 rivers cross it.&nbsp; It was raining most of the morning as we travelled throughout the area.<br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_5040_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5040_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_5035_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5035_edited_small.jpg" width="180" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>After an early lunch we&nbsp;drove about 130 km to the Baoding Grotto to view the&nbsp;rock carvings.&nbsp; Dazu Rock Carvings is the general name for over one-hundred cliff grottoes scattered throughout Dazu county.&nbsp; The construction of the grottoes began in the early 600s.&nbsp; They depict a wide range of subjects, stories and scenes from daily life.&nbsp; In total there are 60,000 statue carvings and 100,000 inscriptions in 75 locations.&nbsp; Our itinerary called for us to visit a second&nbsp;grotto&nbsp;however, after the 2 hour ride to get to Dazu and another 2 hours back, the group opted to visit a farm family compound instead.&nbsp; One of the advantages of having a smaller group &ndash; we could make those kinds of changes.<img height="240" alt="P1000527_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000527_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This farm compound is home to an extended family.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was built in a square with&nbsp;a central courtyard&nbsp;that led to each of the houses and also the buildings for animals and storage.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_5058_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5058_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We were invited in to one of the houses and were impressed with the cleanliness even though the floors were dirt.&nbsp; In the bedroom, the bed was covered by a satin bedspread and the clothes hung carefully from the rafters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the kitchen, there was one electrical plug with extension cords to a light and a wok.<br clear="right"><img style="WIDTH: 209px; HEIGHT: 268px" height="240" alt="IMG_5059_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5059_edited_small.jpg" width="181" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grandmother seemed to be the one taking care of the little one.&nbsp; She was dressed in what we would consider more traditional clothing.&nbsp; The baby&rsquo;s mother and other family members that we met &nbsp;were dressed in blue jeans, sneakers and T shirts.</p>
<p>There are many minority groups in China and the Tibetan heritage is evident in much of the population.<br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_5053_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5053_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" border="2" vspace="4"/></p>
<p>&nbsp;We passed acres and acres of rice paddies.&nbsp; Many were quite small with earthen dikes between the fields.&nbsp; In order to take advantage of every bit of land, the tops of the dikes, perhaps one foot wide,&nbsp;were often planted with corn.</p>
<p>This is back breaking work,&nbsp;as each&nbsp;seedling is planted by hand, bent over in a flooded field. <br clear="right"></p><img style="WIDTH: 346px; HEIGHT: 259px" height="240" alt="IMG_5051_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5051_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>Although the rice fields in many places are first cultivated by machines, when they have been flooded, the water buffalo is still the only one that doesn&rsquo;t get stuck.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_5066_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5066_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>From the simplicity of the farm to the cosmopolitan of the city. </p>
<p>Looking down from our hotel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>From our observation each city has a colour for it&rsquo;s taxis.&nbsp; We only saw yellow&nbsp;in Chongqing.<br clear="right">Early the next morning, we took the monorail to the Chongqing Zoo.&nbsp; We thought it strange as we went<img height="240" alt="P1000562" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000562_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /> to board, we descended two very long escalators as if we were going into a subway.&nbsp; However, very shortly after boarding, the train came into the open.&nbsp; Turns out that with the mountains in the city the monorail sometimes has to tunnel through them.</p>
<p>This was one of the adults and she will sit and eat bamboo half the day.&nbsp; Because bamboo has so few vitamins, a panda must consume up to 20 kg (44 lbs) a day.&nbsp; They eat all parts of the plant including the stems.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the zoo, they are given other types of food such as sugar cane, carrots, sweet potatoes and special high-fibre &ldquo;panda bread&rdquo;.<br clear="left">&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="IMG_5071_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5071_edited_small.jpg" width="166" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="P1000556" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1000556_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>This is a year old baby that was born at this zoo. It was trying to get comfortable in the tree to have a sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Panda&rsquo;s are not very active in captivity, interesting and endangered&nbsp;&nbsp;but not very active.&nbsp; I guess when you don&rsquo;t have to forage for food&nbsp;10 to 16 hours a day, you just get to sit around &amp; eat instead.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 244px; HEIGHT: 302px" height="240" alt="IMG_5079" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5079_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we left the zoo we visited&nbsp;the Chiqikou old town area which has a history of more than 1,800 years.&nbsp; It is about an hours drive from the city centre and has been preserved in the midst of&nbsp;sprawling modern Chongqing.&nbsp; The name means porcelain harbour and the community prospered from the fancy blue and white porcelain of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>The town was very busy with many vendors on the two main streets.<br clear="left">We had a 3 pm flight to our next stop, Xian, and after lunch we headed to the airport.</p>
<p>Xian is our jumping off point to see the Terracotta Warriors so our next journal&nbsp;is from there.</p>
