<h3>Jasper and the Icefields Parkway</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="Jasper Park Lodge 002" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Jasper_20Park_20Lodge_20002_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />Going to Jasper, Alberta was a sentimental journey for me (Bernie).&nbsp; I know that I am giving away my age &ndash; but what the heck.&nbsp; I worked at Jasper Park Lodge for 2 summers in the early 60s and it was one of the best times of my life.&nbsp; When we visited the Lodge for Sunday night dinner with our friends Deborah and George, we took&nbsp;a walk around the staff quarters and the old part of the main lodge.&nbsp; I must admit that it was rather emotional, standing in the former dining room at my old station.&nbsp; Many memories. The room is now only used for banquets and big functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been usurped&nbsp;by newer and shinier rooms &ndash; but somehow, I don&rsquo;t think they are an improvement.&nbsp; Nothing like the original elegance.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7798_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7798_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />We dry camped at a campground just south of the town of Jasper, in Jasper National Park, which was established in 1907.&nbsp; Because hunting is illegal, many of the animals have lost their fear of humans.&nbsp; This was obvious when a herd of elk decided that the grass around our trailer was to their liking.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7682_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7682_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />Aug. 4th,&nbsp;Monday morning, the four of us headed out toward Maligne Lake, one of the most photographed lakes in the entire Rockies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we had to pass Medicine Lake and found it to be very&nbsp;picturesque as well.</p>
<p>Medicine Lake is a temporary lake &ndash; filling with the spring snow melt and gradually lowering as the summer goes along until it is a frozen&nbsp;meandering river in the winter.&nbsp; But there is no visible outlet to this &ldquo;lake&rdquo;.&nbsp; In fact the Maligne River flows in to it from the south and the lake drains through &ldquo;sink holes&rdquo; in the bottom and resurfaces in the area of Maligne Canyon, some 16 km downstream.<br clear="right"><img height="180" alt="164_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/164_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maligne Lake is very beautiful and winds 14 miles beneath towering mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7701_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7701_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>The Maligne River drops from the higher Maligne Valley to the Athabasca Valley below.&nbsp; In doing so it has eroded a narrow canyon.&nbsp; In some cases the canyon is only a few&nbsp;feet wide, but as much as&nbsp;200 ft. deep.&nbsp; The beautiful turquoise colour of the river adds to the drama of the eroded rocks.</p>
<p>There was major restoration work being done on the paths when we visited Maligne Canyon, &nbsp;so unfortunately we were not able to go all the way along the canyon rim.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="209_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/209_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />Late in the afternoon, Deborah and I travelled by tram to the top of Whistler&rsquo;s Mountain overlooking Jasper.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tram rises from the Lower Station at 4,279 ft. above sea level to the Upper station at 7,472 ft above sea level.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another memory.&nbsp; While working at the lodge in the early 60s,&nbsp; a friend and I had climbed to the top of Whistler&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The tram wasn&rsquo;t completed until 2 years later.&nbsp; The view was just as spectacular this time.&nbsp; The mountains don&rsquo;t change, although the town of Jasper has grown somewhat.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the Athabasca River in the valley below.&nbsp; I remember being so impressed when I first arrived in Jasper, to actually be seeing a river that I had only heard about in history and geography classes.<br clear="left"><img height="180" alt="205_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/205_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another view from the top.<br clear="right">Monday, was a holiday &ndash; in Ontario it&rsquo;s called Civic Holiday &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure what it&rsquo;s called in Alberta but it&rsquo;s a holiday.&nbsp; Deb &amp; George had headed home after dinner&nbsp;so the next morning we headed south on our own, down the Icefields Parkway.</p>
<p>In 1931, the Canadian Government put hundreds of unemployed men to work building this trail through the Canadian Rockies.&nbsp; It runs 230 km between Jasper and Lake Louise and is entirely within two national parks (Banff is the other one).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a scenic drive &ndash; large trucks are banned.</p>
<p>Pictures tell the drive best:</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7734_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7734_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7728" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7728_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>Athabasca Falls: </p>
<p>23 metres high (80 ft) and 60 ft. wide.&nbsp; It is known for the&nbsp;power of the falling water as the Athabasca River thunders through a narrow gorge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="196" alt="262_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/262_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="270_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/270_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="274_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/274_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7776_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7776_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="IMG_7789" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7789_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>The Columbia Icefield is astride the Continental Divide and feeds eight major glaciers.&nbsp; This is the Athabasca Glacier which is located close to the Icefields Parkway.&nbsp; It is the most visited glacier in North America but has receded over 1.5 km in the past 125 years &ndash; and lost half its volume.</p>
<p>We walked to the edge of it.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7791_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7791_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back north from the glacier parking lot.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We only had time to travel as far as the Athabasca Glacier and even then we took all day as we stopped so many times.<br clear="left">We enjoyed our time in Jasper.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lovely town and still not as commercial as Banff.&nbsp; We did spend time walking around, checking out&nbsp;an art show and the shops.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the vendors, we don&rsquo;t buy a lot of&nbsp; &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.&nbsp; We sold most of our &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;&nbsp; when we started this adventure and we don&rsquo;t need to restock.&nbsp; We have a rule &ndash; if we buy something new, we have to get rid of something old.&nbsp; Keeps us from getting overloaded.</p>
<p>Wednesday, Aug. 6th, we headed back along the Yellowhead, past Mt. Robson to the junction at Tete Jaune Cache, then south on Highway 5 in British Columbia.</p>

<p> It is several years since we visited the places you mentioned and they are as beautiful in your pictures as they ever were. <br />

<p>So, who worked at Jasper Park Lodge?  Want to really date me--the first time I saw the Columbia River Icefields was in 1949--the road was all gravel and beyond there they were pulling cars thru behind a "cat".  Gorgeous pictures--such beautiful country--just hope it doesn't become too commercialized-last time I saw Banff it certainly wasn't the town I remembered from the previous 3 times I had been there.  Love everything you send!  Sincerely, Bette </p>

<p>Fantastic views as always.</p>

<p>We're off to Vegas on Sunday - Jill's never seen it, and I haven't been there for 15 years.  We'll certainly take pictures, but they won't be anywhere near as majestic as yours.  They will be kitschy, though.</p>

<p>Happy driving to you both, and all the best from J & A.</p>
