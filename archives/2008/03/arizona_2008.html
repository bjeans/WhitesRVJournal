<h3>Arizona 2008</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s been cold this winter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, yes, I know it hasn&rsquo;t been as cold as in Ontario, but we came south to&nbsp;stay warm.&nbsp; In Silver City, it was below freezing most nights so we travelled south to within a 1/2 kilometer of the Mexican border&nbsp;to Naco, Arizona.&nbsp; It was below freezing the first night we were there. &nbsp; Oh well, at least I&rsquo;m not shovelling snow!</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 239px; HEIGHT: 294px" height="240" alt="IMG_5964_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5964_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bisbee, AZ is about 15 miles north of Naco, and is the main reason that we came into this area.&nbsp; We were here 2 years ago (<em><font size="2">see the journal February 2005</font></em>) and enjoyed the town so much we&nbsp;decided to come back for another visit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This old copper mining town, originally founded in the last half of the 1800&rsquo;s is now a haven for artists, sculptors and other artisans.&nbsp; Old buildings have been lovingly and quite authentically restored.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1020276_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1020276_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />The Copper Queen&nbsp;Lode was the basis of the community but all the mines closed in the early 1970&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The town now runs tours of the mine, so we decided to don hats, slickers and lamps and&nbsp;head underground for the&nbsp;1 1/2 hour tour.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tours are given by miners who actually worked in the mines so you get a very personal and knowledgeable picture.&nbsp; We travelled by tram into the mountain &ndash; about&nbsp;1,500 feet&nbsp;and into various caverns that were formed by the removal of the ore.&nbsp; At one point we all turned off our battery powered lamps &ndash; now that is dark!</p>
<p>During it&rsquo;s 100 years of operation the mine produced more than eight BILLION pounds of copper as well as substantial amounts of silver, lead zinc and gold &ndash; one of Arizona&rsquo;s richest mines.&nbsp; Bisbee&rsquo;s mines, including the Queen Mine, have more than 2,500 miles of tunnels.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>Our next stop was Tucson where we set up camp for&nbsp;two weeks. My sister Joan, who lives in Fredericton, NB&nbsp;is there for a couple of months so we had&nbsp;great visits with her.&nbsp; We also visited the casinos, played golf a couple of times, had great Mexican food, attended a &ldquo;Canadian&rdquo; pot luck at the park, visited the Tucson Museum of Art, attended the Gem and Mineral Show, got a haircut,&nbsp;had the trailer washed and in general relaxed and enjoyed ourselves.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6002_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6002_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />One day we drove the 30 miles to Mount Lemmon, which is in the Santa Catalina Mountains to the north of the city.&nbsp; At 9,157 ft., the highest mountain in the area offers both downhill and cross country skiing.&nbsp; The day after we had arrived&nbsp; in Tucson, there was a major snow storm&nbsp;and the road&nbsp;was closed&nbsp;until plows could finally clear it.&nbsp; Even in the summer the temperature is 20 &ndash; 30 degrees F lower than in the valley.<br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 249px; HEIGHT: 308px" height="240" alt="IMG_6003" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6003_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The mountains are very rugged and barren until you get to the higher elevations,&nbsp;where first shrubs, then finally trees are present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just before the ski area is the resort town of Summerhaven.&nbsp; The village has been a haven from the high summer temperatures since the early 1900&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In 2003&nbsp;it was devastated by the Aspen fire that burned 84,750 acres and destroyed 340 of the 450 homes and businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s amazing how these huge fires can skip individual homes and trees and consume others.&nbsp;&nbsp; No rhyme or reason.&nbsp; The town is gradually rebuilding but there is still little permanent population, although we did see signs for new condominiums.&nbsp;<br clear="right"></p>
<p>We said goodbye to Joan and made for Apache Junction just&nbsp;east of&nbsp;Phoenix on Monday February 18th.&nbsp; We like Phoenix, we like it&rsquo;s people and we like it&rsquo;s atmosphere.&nbsp; We are very impressed by the landscaping along its roads and streets.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t try to grow grass &ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s desert &ndash; but they do use the native cactus and shrubs effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6026_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6026_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We spent one day driving The Apache Trail which was created in 1905 to transport supplies to the construction site of Roosevelt Dam.&nbsp;The road&nbsp;follows the ancient route of the Apaches through the Salt River Canyons. It runs north east for&nbsp;41 miles from Apache Junction to Roosevelt through rugged, beautiful steep sided canyons, rock outcroppings and mountain vistas.&nbsp; You need to allow about 4 hours to do the drive.<br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="IMG_6031_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6031_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to&nbsp;travel from west to east as the&nbsp;secure rock walls will then be beside you rather than the steep cliffs on the other side.&nbsp; The road is paved for the first half, but the last&nbsp;part is gravel and very challenging with most of the road with a speed limit of 15 mph.&nbsp;&nbsp; On one curve we were able to see the wrecks of 5 vehicles in the canyon below.<br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="P1020368_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1020368_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>The road&nbsp;down&nbsp;into Fish Creek Canyon drops 1,500 feet in about 2 miles and hangs on the side of the canyon.&nbsp; It is mostly one lane, with&nbsp;widened spots&nbsp;to allow cars to meet. &nbsp;In the picture to the right,&nbsp;the road is in the foreground and also&nbsp;in the centre back. (It looks more like a river)</p>
<p>But&nbsp;the scenery is beautiful and we&nbsp;are glad we took the time to drive it. <br clear="right"><img height="121" alt="IMG_6055_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6055_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We left the Phoenix area heading east and then south east.&nbsp; We had been noticing how green the desert was this year.&nbsp; What a difference rain makes!<br clear="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our next destination is Clifton, Arizon which is&nbsp;on the very eastern side of Arizon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s there we find the&nbsp;huge Morenci copper mine which is&nbsp;where we are headed.</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross&nbsp;</p>
