<h3>Yellowknife, NWT to Dempster Corners, YK</h3>

<p>A couple of note-worthy sightings as we headed back on our long detour:</p>
<p><img height="181" alt="IMG_6680_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6680_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Highway from Yellowknife borders the Mackenzie Buffalo Preserve and on our return trip we&nbsp;saw close to 200 animals &ndash;&nbsp;one herd we counted 67 adults and 7 calves.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp;waited about 15 minutes for the herd to cross the road. <br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="Ross pictures 004_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20pictures_20004_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The babies were so cute and stayed right beside the Moms.<br clear="left"><img height="240" alt="Ross pictures 011_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20pictures_20011_edited_small.jpg" width="196" align="right" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have now travelled the full length of the Mackenzie Highway which begins in Grimshaw, Alberta and ends in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>We headed west from Grimshaw and arrived in Dawson Creek, British Columbia&nbsp; mid day on May 30th, 2008.&nbsp;<br clear="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img height="338" alt="IMG_6711_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6711_edited_small1.jpg" width="450" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>A sign at the obelisk reads:</p>
<p><strong><em>At this spot in the spring of 1942 at the height of World War 2 the US&nbsp;Army engineers began the construction of the overland route to Alaska.&nbsp; Nine months later at a cost of over $140,000,000 the road was completed.&nbsp; This is a road construction feat unsurpassed in modern times.&nbsp; 11,000 troops &amp; 16,000 civilians were employed in this project.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>There are 133 bridges&nbsp;&amp; 8,000 culverts embodied in the 1523 miles of gravel highway.&nbsp; The rattle and roar of the mighty bulldozers was a source of amazement to both the local white man and the northern Indian.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Over this lifeline to the Northwest, thousands of troops, food &amp; war supplies have been transported, in more recent times the mighty H&nbsp;bomb was known to travel this route.&nbsp; It was maintained by the Canadian Army until April 1964; maintenance was then taken over by the Dept. of Public Works, Ottawa.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having now travelled many miles of this road, we are absolutely astounded that it was built in the time frame that they did it.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6712" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6712_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" />The current highway bears no resemblance to the original road.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now pavement the whole way with gas and other services at regular intervals.&nbsp; The original was a mud track to&nbsp;move military supplies.&nbsp; The road then immediately began continuous upgrades. It has been straightened and flattened, bridges have been built to replace ferries and the road base has been totally overhauled. It&rsquo;s a long road but no longer the endurance trip it once was.</p>
<p>We took a side trip to travel about 4 miles of the original road.&nbsp; This curved bridge with its&nbsp;plank surface&nbsp;is unique. <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6718_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6718_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>Our second day as we travelled from Fort Nelson toward Muncho Lake, the vistas were beautiful. <br clear="right" ?>
<p><img height="192" alt="IMG_6754_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6754_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>We stayed at Northern Rockies Lodge &amp; RV Park on Muncho Lake.&nbsp; It was expensive &ndash; $35.50 for water and 15 amp power &ndash; and the sites were marginal.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they are in the middle of nowhere, they make all their own power by generator and they have a captive clientele. So what did we expect?</p>
<p>The lake was a beautiful blue green.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="215" alt="IMG_6765_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6765_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>After stopping the next morning for a swim at&nbsp;Liard Hot Springs Provincial Park&nbsp;(I hoped it was the fountain of youth &ndash;&nbsp;but no such luck)&nbsp;we continued toward Watson Lake through some very rugged terrain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There have been some steep hills and some long ones but seldom both steep&nbsp;and long.&nbsp; We travel mainly the river valleys.<br clear="right">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Ross pictures 025" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20pictures_20025_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" />Watson Lake, in the Yukon, was first settled by a trapper in 1898 but now is most famous for its signpost forest that sits right beside the highway and the Visitor&rsquo;s Centre.&nbsp; It was started by a homesick soldier in 1942&nbsp;during construction of the Alaska Hwy.</p>
<p>In talking to the staff at the Visitor&rsquo;s Centre, we&nbsp;found out&nbsp;that there are now over 65,000 signs posted there.</p>
<p>Our travelling partners, Bev &amp; Ron, had brought a sign with them so there was one more by the time we left.<br clear="left">&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="Ross pictures 029_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20pictures_20029_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>Waterfalls &amp; mountains between Watson Lake &amp; Teslin</p>
<p><img height="187" alt="Ross pictures 027_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20pictures_20027_edited_small1.jpg" width="300" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bev &amp; Ron had never been to Skagway and travelling by highway to it is totally different than&nbsp;as we saw it on the cruise in 2005.&nbsp; We decided to stay a couple of nights in Carcross, YK and drive the&nbsp;100 km down there with just the truck.&nbsp; One of the problems with pulling&nbsp;the trailer on mountain roads, is that the driver doesn&rsquo;t have&nbsp;much of&nbsp;an opportunity&nbsp;to check out the scenery.&nbsp; Sometimes, it&rsquo;s nice just to take the truck.</p>
<p>This is a bit of what we saw on our trip&nbsp;to Skagway.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 391px; HEIGHT: 259px" height="206" alt="IMG_6823_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6823_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 389px; HEIGHT: 281px" height="211" alt="IMG_6831_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6831_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We arrived in Whitehorse, YK&nbsp;on Sat. June the 8th and spent 3 nights there.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a thriving community of about 24,000 people.&nbsp; The population of the whole of the Yukon Territory is only around 30,000.&nbsp; It began during the Kondike gold rush and was the terminus of the White Pass and Yukon&nbsp;Route railway.&nbsp; Sternwheelers travelled from Whitehorse on to Dawson City.&nbsp; It was also a major construction location during the building of the Alcan (Alaska) Highway.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Whitehorse is named after the historic rapids on the Yukon river which resembled the flowing manes of charging white horses.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Whitehorse to Skagway 001" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Whitehorse_20to_20Skagway_20001_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />As of 1953 it became the capital of the Yukon Territory and as is our practice, we visited the Legislature.</p>
<p>The regular tour guide was off sick and our &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; tour guide turned out to be the Clerk of the Legislature so we had a very informative and insightful visit.&nbsp; <br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="181" alt="Whitehorse to Skagway 002_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Whitehorse_20to_20Skagway_20002_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="3" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took a tour of the S.S. Klondike, a restored stern-wheeler that plyed the Yukon River.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; one of the largest ships to travel the route and ran from 1937 to 55. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Beringia Interpretive Centre we&nbsp;learned about the ancient sub-continent of Beringia, an area of the Yukon, Alaska and Siberia never covered by glaciers during the last ice age.&nbsp;&nbsp; The water trapped in the ice that covered the rest of North America, caused the ocean levels to drop,&nbsp;exposing the ocean floor between Alaska and Russia.&nbsp; It is believed that this is the route travelled by the first people&nbsp;to enter America from Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient area was populated by wooly mammoths, scimitar cats and giant beavers among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6879_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6879_edited_small.jpg" width="229" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />We had a fun night out at the &ldquo;Frantic Follies&rdquo;, a Gay &lsquo;90s vaudeville revue.</p>
<p><img height="251" alt="IMG_6876_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6876_edited_small1.jpg" width="300" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also included an excellent performance of the Robert Service poem &ldquo;The Cremation of Sam McGee&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We left Whitehorse on June 10th and about 12 km outside the city, we turned north on the Klondike Highway.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll come back to this corner on the Alaska Highway on our way out of the north.&nbsp; We travelled quite steadily, stopping for the night at Pelly Crossing and arriving in Dempster Corners,&nbsp;&nbsp;490 km from Whitehorse and 40 km from Dawson City, the following&nbsp; day.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="218" alt="IMG_6905_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6905_edited_small.jpg" width="290" vspace="2" border="2" /><img height="208" alt="IMG_6959_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6959_edited_small.jpg" width="290" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We stayed at the campground at Dempster Corners, left our trailer in their back lot for 5 days and took only the truck up the Dempster Highway to Inuvik.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next journal.</p>
