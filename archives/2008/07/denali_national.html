<h3>Denali National Park & Preserve</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="271" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/271_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="3" border="2" />On Tuesday July 8<sup>th</sup>, we arrived at Denali RV Park and Motel, just north of the National Park.&nbsp; Denali (&ldquo;High One&rdquo; in the Athabascan First Nation language, referring to Mt. McKinley) National Park and Preserve is the largest national park at just over 6,000,000 acres and visitors see only a tiny piece of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The park is bigger than Massachusetts and almost 4 times bigger than Prince Edward Island. Like the Dempster Highway, Denali and Mt McKinley were high on our list of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">&lsquo;Must See&rsquo;</i> places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
<p><br clear="right"></p>
<p>The park began as Mt. McKinley National Park (after the US senator and later US President) in 1917 and went through several size and name changes until 1980 when it was expanded to its current size, with its current name, by an act of the Alaskan legislature. It is now composed of 3 distinct sections &ndash; Denali Wilderness, a highly regulated area to maintain its unspoiled parkland characteristics; Denali National Preserve which allows subsistence and sport hunting, fishing and trapping under Alaska regulations; Denali National Park which allows customary and traditional subsistence uses for local resident Alaskans. Overall the park is home to some of the largest North American mammals and some of the smallest plant varieties. Mt. McKinley continues to be the biggest attraction in the park and at 20,320 feet is the highest peak in North America. Of greater importance, is has the greatest vertical exposure, over 18,000 feet, of any mountain in the world including Mt. Everest.</p>
<p>That afternoon we went <span lang="EN-CA"><img style="WIDTH: 383px; HEIGHT: 215px" height="156" alt="267" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/267_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" /></span>to the Visitor Centre to book a tour and then went to a sled dog demonstration. To preserve the natural environment of Denali, the park is patrolled in winter only by dog team &ndash; no motorized vehicles are used. The dogs were on show for our group of about 120 visitors. <br clear="left"></p>
<p>The next morning at 10, we were at the bus depot for our 8 hour park bus tour. Ross on a bus for 8 hours NO WAY, but any way &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; .<br clear="left"></p>
<p>At Denali you can only drive private vehicles about 15 miles into the park to the Savage River outlook, so they have 2 types of bus trips for visitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tours on the Green bus cost about $30 and are like a city bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They stop at pre-arranged places, but also will pick up people along the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The drivers are not professional interpretive guides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tan colour bus trips are about $100, take around 10 hours, include a box lunch and water and carry a professional narrator/guide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Green Bus trip we chose was to the new Eielson Visitor Centre 66 miles into the park (the road only runs for 89 miles).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You take your own food and drink.</span> </p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span lang="EN-CA">Our driver was<img height="225" alt="326" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/326_small.jpg" width="300" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" /> in his fifth year and was terrific.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doing the trip 5 days a week, he knew pretty well where the animals were likely to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His instruction as we left was that if he was talking and we saw animals we were to yell &lsquo;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">stop&rsquo; </i></b>and then tell everyone where to look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That day we saw grizzlies, caribou, Dall sheep, moose, black bears, and coyotes ... but no <?xml:namespace prefix ="" st1 /><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">Mt.</st1:placetype> <st1:placename w:st="on">McKinley</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is about 35 miles at its closest point to the road system and is often hidden in cloud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only about 20% of the time is it completely visible.<br clear="left"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span lang="EN-CA"><img height="240" alt="IMG_7436_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7436_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" />One section of the road is built right into the side of the mountain and is only one vehicle wide with shallow widening so that buses can meet.&nbsp; The rule is &ndash;&nbsp;the upbound bus has the right of way.&nbsp; We were very glad that we had professional drivers when the buses met on a couple of the curves.&nbsp;</span><br clear="left"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span lang="EN-CA">There were two stops each way at&nbsp;panoramic viewpoints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At Eielson we stopped for about an hour and a half, ate our lunch, viewed the exhibits (which were excellent) and took many photos of the magnificent vistas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We both use digital cameras so we just keep shooting and review/edit them back at the trailer at night. <img height="240" alt="316_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/316_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="3" border="2" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt"><span lang="EN-CA">The land is huge &ndash; note the road in the bottom right of this photo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were National Park rangers available to answer questions and point out special features of the area. One of the stops on the return trip was at a very good book store (literally in the middle of nowhere).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">The Denali town site, just outside the entrance to the park is made up of the usual assortment of convenience restaurants, gift shops and services typically found around a major tourist attraction. But it also has 2 major hospitality facilities; one owned by Princess Cruise Line and the other by Holland-America Cruise Line. They even have their own passenger rail cars used by the Alaska Railroad to bring guests from Fairbanks and Anchorage, every day during the tourist season.&nbsp; In fact, we saw their sight seeing buses and hotels all over Alaska and Yukon &ndash;&nbsp;they are a major tourism influence.</p>
<p>Now we head further north to Fairbanks.</p>

<p>So sorry you did not get to see the mountain.  My sister has been there several times and stayed in the park for 2 nites--mountain was crystal clear for 3 days.  She actually had a picture of it as a screen saver on her computer.  Would be so exciting to see all the animals.  I only hope as a nation we will keep this area and much of Alaska as it is--always a worry with a republican administration.  Sincerely, Bette</p>
