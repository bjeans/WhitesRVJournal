<h3>Alberta again - Summer 2008</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7995_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7995_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />In the middle of the night the mountain fell.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At 4:10 am on April 29, 1903 ninety million tons of limestone crashed from the summit of Turtle Mountain and buried part of the sleeping town of Frank, AB.&nbsp; 70 of the 100 people in the path of the slide were killed.</p>
<p>The rock mass that fell&nbsp;was 150 metres (500 feet) deep, 425 metres (1,400) high and 1km (3,280) wide and covered an area of 3 square kilometers (1.2 sq. miles)<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7985" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7985_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />The rocks are huge and the debris field is eerie to wander through.</p>
<p>The primary cause of the Frank Slide was a combination of the mountain&rsquo;s unstable geological structure, water action in cracks,&nbsp;underground coal mining and severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>Mind you, the First Nation residents of the area already called it &ldquo;the mountain that moves&rdquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t camp at the base.&nbsp; They were smart!<br clear="left"></p>
<p>The road today runs right through the debris field and the railroad also runs at&nbsp;its base.&nbsp; The mountain is still unstable and we learned that many sensors have been placed and are constantly monitored.&nbsp; The Interpretive Centre opened after extensive renovation, a few days after we visited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Municipality of Crowsnest Pass is made up of the former coal-mining towns of Bellevue, Blairmore, Coleman, Frank and Hillcrest and we spent another day visiting the various historic sites in these villages.</p>
<p>Wed. morning, August 27th. we headed east, still on Hwy 3.&nbsp; When we reached Hwy 22 about&nbsp;20 km down the road, we turned north toward Calgary.&nbsp;<img height="206" alt="Ross - Alberta 006_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20006_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>On our way up Hwy 22, we stopped at the Bar U Ranch, a National Historic Site.&nbsp;This ranch, founded in 1882, at it largest, encompassed 157,960 acres and reported 10,410 cattle and 832 horses.</p>
<p>The buildings are original, although some have been moved&nbsp;from outlying areas and the backdrop of the Rockies is beautiful.<br clear="right">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Ross - Alberta 007" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20007_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They had a &ldquo;round&nbsp;-up camp&rdquo; set up and we had our first taste of bannock.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an unleavened dough that is&nbsp;fried in&nbsp;fat in a heavy frying pan, over the open coals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had it served with both jam and a honey walnut spread.and it was very good.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Ross - Alberta 005_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20005_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We have been travelling so long through mountains that it was quite a change (relief?)&nbsp;to come into the foothills and be able to see long vistas and generally flat roads.</p>
<p>A visit with my cousin and his wife, a visit to&nbsp;a dentist for an abscessed tooth, as well as taking the trailer in to the Hitchhicker dealer for some maintenance took a couple of days while we were in Calgary.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Ross - Alberta 009_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20009_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We visited the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller which is about 125 km (75 miles) north&nbsp;east of the city.&nbsp; Internationally recognized for its palaeontological research, extraordinary collections and dynamic galleries, it sets out the story of the evolution of earth and the golden age of dinosaurs.&nbsp; We had visited there many years ago &ndash; I think about 1987 &ndash; and found many new and much improved exhibits this time.<br clear="left">
<p></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Ross - Alberta 011_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20011_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We returned to Calgary by a different route, driving south on the Hoodoo Trail about&nbsp;16 km (10 miles)&nbsp;along the Red Deer River before heading cross country back to the city.</p>
<p>The strange sandstone formations called Hoodoos are found right beside the highway and there are&nbsp;trails through them that can be hiked.&nbsp;They are very fragile so no climbing.</p>
<p>Hoodoos are sandstone pillars resting on a thick base of shale that is capped by a large stone.&nbsp; The cap rock is very hard and protects the soft lower layers from erosion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the Blackfoot and Cree traditions, the Hoodoos come alive at night to hurl rocks at intruders.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="Ross - Alberta 013_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20013_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>It was an easy drive south from Calgary on Hwy 2 and we travelled through beautiful flat rich aglicultural land (note the irrigation circles).</p>
<p>We stayed in Fort Macleod, as a base camp, &nbsp;for 3 nights, as we wanted to visit areas both east and west of the town, and it&rsquo;s much easier taking only the truck.<br clear="left">After we set up at the campground, and it was early in the afternoon, we&nbsp;headed east to Lethbridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city&nbsp;was founded in 1870 and is an agricultural centre as the area reportedly receives more hours of sunshine annually than any other spot in Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img height="185" alt="Ross - Alberta 012_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20012_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />As most of you know, Ross has a penchant for trains, and things train. Lethbridge is the home to reputedly the longest and highest bridge of its type and construction in the world. </p>
<p>Built in 1909 it is 5,327 ft. (1,623 metres) in length (1 mile plus 47 feet).</p>
<p>It is still in use today.</p>
<p>Sept 2nd, our first full day in the area we went to Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, a Provincial, National, and UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>Native people stampeded&nbsp;bison over these cliffs, channeling them to the drop by cleverly placing rock and trees and directing the herd with waving arms, yelling and arrows.&nbsp; <img style="WIDTH: 340px; HEIGHT: 222px" height="192" alt="IMG_8027_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8027_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />The buffalo provided them with food, clothing, tools and shelter, ensuring their survival.</p>
<p>The name comes from a young brave who wanted to witness the spectacle from under a ledge at the foot of the cliff.&nbsp; Unfortunately, his skull was crushed as he became trapped between the carcasses and the cliff.</p>
<p>The seven story interpretive center, built into the cliff, has displays focusing on geographical and climatic factors of the tribes.&nbsp; There are also short trails leading to the hunting site.</p>
<p>We continued further west, to return to the Frank Slide area, so we could visit the Interpretive Centre which had been closed earlier.&nbsp; It provides history about the area and the mining that took place there as well as the slide (of course).&nbsp; It was well worth the return visit.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 356px; HEIGHT: 191px" height="150" alt="Ross - Alberta 014_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Ross_20_2D_20Alberta_20014_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>On our way there, we followed a gravel road for about 40 km. and saw some huge cattle herds. </p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve travelled a lot of miles on this trip on gravel roads and never had a mishap.</p>
<p>Yes, you guessed it. On this stretch of gravel a stone flew up from a truck we met and hit the windsheild.&nbsp; We ended up staying another day in Fort Macleod to get it replaced.</p>
<p>We left Fort Macleod on the morning of Sept 4th, with our destination somewhere close to Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_8051_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8051_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /> We only had about 100 km (62 miles) to travel, so we had lots of time to stop in Cardston, at the Remington Carriage Museum.&nbsp; It houses the largest collection of horse drawn vehicles in North America &ndash; 250 pieces of buggies, carriages, wagons and sleighs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Started in 1954 as a private collection, Don Reminton donated his then&nbsp;48 vehicles to the Province in 1987.&nbsp; Alberta built the beautiful museum and consolidated another 175 vehicles in the same place.&nbsp; Another excellent stop.</p>
<p>After lunch we finished our trip to the Waterton area and set up camp a bit outside the park.</p>
<p>Ross is writing about our visit to this National Park that is twinned with Glacier&nbsp; NP in the U.S.</p>
