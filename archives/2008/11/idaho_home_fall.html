<h3>Idaho & Home - Fall 2008</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_8275_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8275_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We crossed into Idaho, Sept 25th, on Interstate 15, just south of the&nbsp;hamlet of Monida (a combination of Montana &amp; Idaho).&nbsp; We&nbsp;travelled over Monida Pass and were obviously in an area where a lot of wind and blowing snow must occur.&nbsp; For a number of miles&nbsp;we passed permanently installed snow fences, some double and even triple,&nbsp;and&nbsp;were pleased that we were too early for any storms.<br cl="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An interesting stop in the afternoon was at the Idaho Potato Museum in Blackfoot ( Idaho, of course).&nbsp; This is the heart of Idaho&rsquo;s potato industry and the museum had a great variety of exhibits relating to the potato, as well as&nbsp; numerous antique implements, tools and other related items.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t make a long trip to see it, but it&rsquo;s certainly worth a stop when passing by.</p>
<p>Our campground for the night was at the Fort Hall Casino.&nbsp; It was an excellent full service park and only $20 a day.&nbsp; We stayed two nights, going in to Pocatello to see the city and to get an oil change on the truck.&nbsp; That is one thing that Ross is very particular about &ndash; we get it serviced every 5,000 km.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="291" alt="IMG_8284_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8284_edited_small1.jpg" width="500" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We&nbsp;arrived in&nbsp;Utah around noon on Saturday, Sept. 27th and found colour. The hills were beautiful.&nbsp; We had no idea that there was so much&nbsp;variety out here.</p>
<p>We had decided to stay at the KOA in Salt Lake City as it was quite convenient to the downtown area as well as the airport.&nbsp; We were&nbsp;flying home on Tue. the 29th&nbsp; to&nbsp;Toronto and then after picking up a rental car,&nbsp;on to Cambridge for 2 weeks to visit with our family.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We had made an appointment for Monday&nbsp;with State Trailer, to leave the&nbsp;5th wheel&nbsp;while we were away.&nbsp; We needed some work done - our kitchen holding tank was leaking and we needed to have a front jack replaced. </p>
<p>Now, what to do with the truck.&nbsp; Our flight out was at 8 AM and we wouldn&rsquo;t arrive back until the 14th at about 8:30 PM.&nbsp; The only reasonable course was to stay in a hotel both of those night.&nbsp; So, on to the Internet and then out to see them.&nbsp; We found&nbsp;a hotel, about 10 minutes from the airport, with a free shuttle to the airport, a continental breakfast and happy to have us leave the truck in their lot for the 2 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;That problem taken care of.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_8291_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8291_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />We spent the&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;familiarizing ourselves with the city.&nbsp; One stop we made was to visit the grounds and the tabernacle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints &ndash;&nbsp;know commonly as the Morman Church.</p>
<p>This is the temple, but non Mormans are banned from entering. The tabernacle &ndash;&nbsp;home to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir &ndash; is open to everyone and we had a demonstration of the fantastic acoustics. A young lady stood at the dias at one end of the 6,000 seat auditorium and dropped a straight pin.&nbsp; We could hear it clearly, at the back of the room, as it landed and then bounced twice more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s&nbsp;very easy to get around Salt Lake City, once you understand the street name system.&nbsp; There are two main streets, Centre and Main and streets are then named from that intersection.&nbsp; The first street east is East 100 the second is East 200, etc.&nbsp; Going south, the first street is South 100 the 2th is South 200 and so on. So, if you want to find 345 West 400 South, you know&nbsp;the&nbsp;location is on West 400 south of Centre Street and between South 300 and South 400.&nbsp; Now that I have everyone totally confused I&rsquo;ll tell you why this is important.&nbsp; Every community in Utah uses this same street numbering system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are a few exception but not enough to really matter.<br clear="right"></p>
<p>Our flight was uneventful and we arrived at Michelle&rsquo;s late Tuesday afternoon, Sept 29th.&nbsp; Mandi and the two boys arrived from the Bahamas on Thursday, Oct 2nd.&nbsp;(Quincy didn&rsquo;t come up this time). </p>
<p>What a joy our grandsons are.</p>
<p><img height="270" alt="071E" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/071E_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timothy &ndash; Michelle&rsquo;s son &ndash; is now 1 year old.&nbsp; We last saw him in April before we started out and he sure has grown.&nbsp; He had his birthday on Oct&nbsp;13th while we were home.&nbsp; He is such a happy little boy with big smiles and he gives the most wonderful sloppy kisses!<br clear="left">&nbsp;<img height="240" alt="039" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/039_small.jpg" width="199" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aiden, Mandi&rsquo;s younger, we last saw mid January when he was only 2 weeks old. He&rsquo;s a very hefty little guy that crawls all over the house. &nbsp;He reached 9 months&nbsp;on Oct 3rd.&nbsp; They grow so fast! &nbsp;I&nbsp;felt tired just watching Mandi&nbsp;carry&nbsp;him around all the time.&nbsp; I know she hopes he walks early.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="063_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/063_edited_small.jpg" width="195" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ricardo, Mandi&rsquo;s elder, again last seen in mid January,who just turned 3 on Sep. 29th.&nbsp; Such a mature young man.&nbsp; He attends pre-school part days and talks a mile a minute with a vocabulary that amazed us.&nbsp; So much bigger and older,&nbsp;but still the enthusiastic joyful grandson we have&nbsp;known.&nbsp;<br clear="left">We had a wonderful time at home but it was busy with every one staying at Shell and Barn&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure they breathed a sigh of relief&nbsp; immediately after we all left &ndash; and then were lonely for us all.</p>
<p><img height="175" alt="IMG_8312_s" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8312_s_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />The first Saturday home, Mandi, Shell and I, along with the little boys went to the &ldquo;Thomas the Train&rdquo; show at the Ricoh Centre in Toronto.&nbsp; Thomas and his friends&nbsp;are&nbsp;favourites of Ricky.&nbsp; Pretty good show. <br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_8327_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8327_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>One day we went on the excursion train from Waterloo to St. Jacobs, then returned to the Farmer&rsquo;s Market for a couple of hours before catching another train back to our starting point.&nbsp; At first Ricky was very timid around the big engine, but with Grandpa&rsquo;s assurance he really enjoyed himself.</p>
<p>Actually, a pretty good ride, with narration all the way to St. Jacobs. &nbsp;At one place we could only go 5 mph as we were travelling on 100 year old track.</p>
<p>We travelled right through the University of Waterloo grounds and beside the many buildings of Research in Motion (RIM) &ndash; makers of the popular Blackberry.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>Our family&nbsp;celebrated our Canadian Thanksgiving on Saturday the11th rather than on Monday the 13th, as that was when the White Clan could get together.&nbsp; We welcomed Jane (she was with us in Alaska for a couple of weeks) and her family, especially another great nephew - Andrew, 2 months old. &nbsp;We also were delighted to see our nephew Michael, who had spent&nbsp;about nine months in the southern Sudan, working with the&nbsp;humanitarian organization, Doctors without Borders.&nbsp; What amazing stories he has to tell.</p>
<p><img height="216" alt="IMG_8351_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8351_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />We spent a day at the African Lion Safari &ndash;&nbsp;an excellent nature park where the visitors are caged and the animals roam quite free.&nbsp; Actually, what happens is you drive your car or take a mini-bus through the park &ndash;&nbsp;and you can&rsquo;t get out.&nbsp; The signs say &ldquo;Trespassers May be Eaten&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We took the mini-bus and had a great time seeing so many animals up close.&nbsp;<br clear="right">&gt;</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_8353_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_8353_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>Another reason we didn&rsquo;t drive is the baboons.&nbsp; They climb all over the cars and vans and they don&rsquo;t care if they scratch.&nbsp; Our van driver stopped near all of the animals and also narrated our tour.&nbsp; We were probably stopped from close to 10 &ndash; 15 minutes in the baboon area as they as so interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the exit gate, there is a park staff with a large stick.&nbsp; Apparently, the baboons sometimes try to hitch a ride to other parts of the park.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>We had dentist and doctor appointments, had lunches with friends and spent wonderful time with family.&nbsp; We also were able to cast our advance vote in the Federal Election.&nbsp; After listening&nbsp;for almost 2 years to the U.S. political election run up, it was refreshing to know that our election was called and over in 40 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two weeks went by very quickly.&nbsp; Mandi and the boys left on Monday the 13th, and we returned to Salt Lake City on the 14th.</p>
<p>We missed them, but we were glad to be going back&nbsp;to our own home.&nbsp; Yes, it may be only a 5th wheel &ndash; but it is home.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll tell you more of our homecoming in the next journal.</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>
