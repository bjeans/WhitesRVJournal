<h2>April 08, 2008</h2>


<h3 id="a000146">Tennessee & Kentucky 2008</h3>

<p><img style="WIDTH: 347px; HEIGHT: 185px" height="159" alt="Texas and East 189_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Texas_20and_20East_20189_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />We crossed the Mississippi into Tennessee on March 24th.&nbsp; The river which is normally wide at this point was massive.&nbsp; It looked more like a lake and the current was&nbsp;obviously very&nbsp;fast.&nbsp; The barges travelling south were making wonderful time but those pushing up-river were working&nbsp;extremely hard and going very slowly.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="223" alt="Texas and East 177_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Texas_20and_20East_20177_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We had visited Elvis&rsquo;s home &ndash; Graceland &ndash; when we visited Memphis while travelling with our girls a bunch of years ago, so other than driving past, didn&rsquo;t visit it this trip.&nbsp; We did however, wander Beale Street and of course had to shop at A. Schwab General Store.&nbsp; It was founded in 1876 and is&nbsp;a through-back to those old days with its ancient wooden plank floors and tables.&nbsp; We saw size 74 men&rsquo;s overalls (now that&rsquo;s BIG), plastic back scratchers, BBQ sauce, every kind of souvenir, jewellery, bongo drums &ndash; you name it they have it.&nbsp; We did buy a neat shorts outfit for Ricky &ndash; all of $3.00.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6216" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6216_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We walked up to the main business street which is now a pedestrian mall.&nbsp; A&nbsp;trolley runs&nbsp; in a loop, along it, down along the river and back to the main&nbsp;mall.&nbsp; It was an interesting ride in a very old style streetcar.&nbsp; We did learn that it was only old style &ndash;&nbsp;it had been built about 4 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We left Memphis and headed northeast through Clarksville on the Tennessee/Kentucky border.&nbsp; A lovely campground &ndash; except &ndash; they don&rsquo;t tell you that there is a scrap yard across the road and the machinery starts working there at 7 in the morning.&nbsp; Oh well, we had planned of getting an early start.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6242_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6242_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next stop, Frankfort, Kentucky, the capital of the state and a city we hadn&rsquo;t spent any time&nbsp;in, in the past.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As we like to do we visited the capital.&nbsp; Again a very impressive building and considered to be one of the most beautiful in the country.&nbsp; The stairs resemble those in the Paris Opera and the State Reception Room is a replica of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s drawing room at Versailles.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6233_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6233_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />A little different tour was the one we took&nbsp;at the Buffalo Trace Bourbon Distillery.&nbsp; We were fortunate that when we asked, they arranged a &ldquo;hard hat&rdquo; tour which not only included the warehouses and bottling houses but also took the group right&nbsp;through the whole distillation process.&nbsp;What the AAA book says is a one hour tour turned out to be about 4 hours.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_6227_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6227_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Buffalo Trace Distillery has continuously produced Bourbon on that site, since 1787.&nbsp; Yes, even through prohibition.&nbsp; It was one of four distilleries in the U.S. that was licenced to produce limited supplies of &ldquo;medicinal&rdquo; whiskey for those citizens with a doctor&rsquo;s prescription for it. </p>
<p>Some interesting facts:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>-currently in the warehouses, should they shut down operations, they have enough aging bourbon, to fulfil sales requirements for 20 years.</p>
<p>&ndash; should you fall into one of the huge vats, trying to swim is useless.&nbsp;&nbsp;The boiling action of the fermentation process will pull you to the bottom.&nbsp; You will&nbsp;drown.</p>
<p>&ndash; it was the first distillery to ship whiskey down the Mississippi River and to use steam power for distilling.</p>
<p>&ndash; in 1886 steam heating was installed making it the the first&nbsp;in the nation to have a climate controlled warehouse for aging whisky. </p>
<p>&ndash; the distillery is built on the &ldquo;trace&rdquo; or track of the huge buffalo herds that crossed the Kentucky River at that location.&nbsp; We hadn&rsquo;t realized that there were such huge herds of buffalo that far east.</p>
<p>They make some well know brands &ndash; Blanton&rsquo;s, Van Winkle, Buffalo Trace and one that Ross bought while we were there &ndash; Eagle Rare &ndash; aged 17 years.</p>
<p>We left Frankfort and headed&nbsp;pretty well straight north, past Cincinnati, Dayton, Toledo and crossed back into Canada 2 days later on Monday, March 31st,&nbsp;at Detroit/Windsor.&nbsp; Since it was only mid afternoon we headed directly to Waterloo and Green Acre Park where we&nbsp;are staying&nbsp;for the month of April.</p>
<p>We had seen no snow until we were south of Toledo, but we were greeted by piles of it in Waterloo.&nbsp; Since the park&nbsp;knew that we were coming, our site had been plowed and was generally bare where we parked but we walked through snow to get around the trailer.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t have park water for 3 days but that was OK as it froze solidly each night and we would have used our on-board water anyway.&nbsp; Maybe next year we will wait a little later to come home.</p>
<p>However, we were there, safe and sound.</p>
<p>April is going to be a busy month as we are heading out again the first of May &ndash; Alaska here we come &ndash; but we&rsquo;ll write more of that later.</p>
<p>Keep those comments coming &ndash; we love to hear from everyone.</p>
<p>Bernie &amp; Ross</p>
