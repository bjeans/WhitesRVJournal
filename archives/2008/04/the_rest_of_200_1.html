<h3>The rest of 2008 Texas</h3>

<p><img height="233" alt="P1020593_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1020593_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Austin, the Texas capital, is named for Stephen F Austin, who brought the first American settlement to Texas in the early 1880s.</p>
<p>The current capital building was completed in 1888 and is clad in Texas &ldquo;sunset-red&rdquo; granite.&nbsp; It is set on 26 acres of landscaped land and is very impressive.&nbsp; We took the guided tour and as we were the only ones on it, we had great opportunity to ask all&nbsp;kinds of&nbsp;questions.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="254" alt="Driskill Hotel_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Driskill_20Hotel_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>At the corner of Brazos &amp; Pecan sits the Driskill Hotel.&nbsp; Built in 1886 this elegant &ldquo;grande dame&rdquo; of city hotels has aged beautifully.&nbsp; It was the center of power brokering in Austin, at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>We toured the hotel and enjoyed a drink in the lobby bar.&nbsp; The ceilings are the original pressed tin and the decor is very elegant. <br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6147" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6147_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We often try to take a city tour as you get so much local history and colour.&nbsp; In Austin we went on the Duck Adventure &ndash; an amphibious military landing vehicle.&nbsp; Not only did&nbsp;the narrated tour&nbsp;take us through the historic district, the U of Texas at Austin&nbsp;and&nbsp;around the Capitol, but we also had a cruise on Lake Austin.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never been on an amphibious vehicle before so it was strange to drive down the boat ramp right&nbsp;into the lake.</p>
<p><br clear="left">The final day we toured the Texas State History Museum. It&rsquo;s a wonderful sprawling 3 floors of interactive exhibits that show the history of the state,&nbsp;from the earliest inhabitants and explorers right up to the contribution to space travel.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1020604" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1020604_small.jpg" width="233" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />The owners and staff at campgrounds where we stay, have given us some of the best hints of things to do,&nbsp;sites to see&nbsp;and places to eat.&nbsp; We took their suggestion for Texas BBQ&nbsp;and stopped in Lockhart on Sunday, March 9th, on our way from Austin to San Antonio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many communities&nbsp;&nbsp;in the U.S. are built around a center square&nbsp;with the Court House&nbsp;in the middle.&nbsp;Most of these buildings are quite impressive but Lockhart, with a population of&nbsp; 11,000+&nbsp;took it to unprecedented levels.&nbsp; It was magnificent!</p>
<p>Unfortunately the properties facing into the square did not live up to the grandeur of the Court but there were two that were picture worthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 246px; HEIGHT: 188px" height="240" alt="P1020610_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1020610_edited_small.jpg" width="320" vspace="4" border="2" /><img style="WIDTH: 292px; HEIGHT: 260px" height="288" alt="P1020611_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1020611_edited_small1.jpg" width="320" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>We thought perhaps the &ldquo;World Finance&rdquo; was a little overstated.</p>
<p>Oh yes!&nbsp; The BBQ was fine &ndash; a pulled pork sandwich &ndash; and the restaurant was doing a bang up business, particularly with the take-out, after church lunch crowd.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_6174" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6174_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="3" border="2" />This&nbsp;was our second visit (<em>see Journal December 06</em>) to&nbsp;San Antonio&nbsp;and we planned on seeing sites we had missed last time.</p>
<p>Back then we had&nbsp;visited the Riverwalk at night, so this time we spent an afternoon strolling along the waterway and walking through the historical part of town.&nbsp; There weren&rsquo;t a lot of people around and away from the river many businesses were not open, but it was a very pleasant time.</p>
<p>In 1718, a Franciscan mission, San Antonio de Valero (later renamed Pueblo del Alamo)&nbsp;was built on the&nbsp; river.&nbsp;Over the next few years a line of missions were built along the river south of town to<img height="240" alt="IMG_6159_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_6159_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /> populate and preserve Spain&rsquo;s hold on the region.&nbsp; By the late 1700&rsquo;s and early 1800&rsquo;s the mission era came to an end and the lands were redistributed among their inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spanish missions helped form the foundation for the city of San Antonio.&nbsp; Fortunately, the community has worked since the 1920&rsquo;s to preserve them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We took&nbsp;the guided tour of Mission San Jose y San Miguel de Aguayo.&nbsp; It was a model of organization and a major social centre.&nbsp; At its peak around 1768, when this building was being built, there were 350 Indians residing in the 84 two-room apartments built into the mission compound walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;San Jose mission continues as an active church in the community.</p>
<p>We headed out to the north east, on Thursday March 14th, for the two day trip to Rusk, TX.&nbsp; Our first night was spent near Brenham and on the advice of a variety store owner, we&nbsp;visited a small Mexican restaurant and had some very excellent food.&nbsp; You never know what you will find where.</p>
<p><img height="203" alt="Rusk 002_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Rusk_20002_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />We needed to be in Rusk on Saturday so that we could take the early morning excursion train on Sunday.&nbsp; We stayed at the campground right beside the railway yards at the Texas State Railroad State Park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This railroad was built&nbsp; around 1881 by prisoners, to transport iron ore to the smelters at the East Texas State Penitentiary in Rusk.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img height="188" alt="Rusk 004_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Rusk_20004_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />We travelled about 25 miles each way, through the local countryside and had lunch in the park at the halfway point.&nbsp; The railway cars and engines have been restored and interestingly it was again prisoners who restored the actual rail line. </p>
<p>It was an interesting day and Ross certainly enjoyed his contact with the railway equipment and employees.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 287px; HEIGHT: 184px" height="240" alt="Texas and East 082" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Texas_20and_20East_20082_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>On Monday, March 17th, we continued our slow road home, travelling to Texarkana, which sits right on the Texas/Arkansas border.&nbsp; The state line runs through the middle of the Post Office &ndash; apparently the only federal building situated in two states. Special legislation by both states created unique legal jurisdictions, applicable only in the building.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="Texarkana theater " hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Texarkana_20theater_20_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Sometimes, we unexpectedly find absolute architectural gems.&nbsp; The 1924 Saenger Theatre (now the Perot Theatre)&nbsp;appeared to be closed, but the box office staff (thanks Traci) were great and we were given a private tour of this marvel.&nbsp; The building has been faithfully restored to its original appearance and is spectacular.&nbsp; It is the center of the performing arts scene and brings classical music, ballet, jazz and&nbsp;Broadway productions to the region.</p>
<p>After our tour of the theater, we walked the short distance to the&nbsp;Regional Arts Center.&nbsp;It shows&nbsp;National touring art exhibitions&nbsp;and is housed in the renovated 1909 District Courthouse.&nbsp; That day they were setting up a show about &ldquo;hats&rdquo;<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="Texas and East 091_edited" hspace="3" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/Texas_20and_20East_20091_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="3" border="2" />The next day we toured the &ldquo;Ace of Clubs House&rdquo;&nbsp; which is a 22 sided house that was built with the winnings from a poker game.&nbsp; It has 3 octagonal wings and one rectangular wing.&nbsp; Looking down on it forms the distinct shape of a &ldquo;club&rdquo;.&nbsp; Most of the furnishings are original and our guide was very knowledgeable about the house and family.&nbsp; She had done a lot of her own research so we got excellent information.</p>
<p>Texarkana, which was home to Pulitzer Prize winning composer Scott Joplin,&nbsp;turned out to be a much more interesting stop than we had anticipated.</p>
<p>Arkansas is a state the we had spent little time in,&nbsp; It was on the next state on our way home so seemed the logical way to head.</p>
