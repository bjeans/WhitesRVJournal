<h3>Jasper to the Okanagan Valley - Summer 2008</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7814_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7814_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />We spent two nights, Aug 6th &amp; 7th&nbsp;in Vailmount, camping at the local golf course.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We were fortunate that the weather was great and we had a good round of golf.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The scores weren&rsquo;t that wonderful but we had fun and a long walk &ndash; and of course we again had impressive clouds over the Rockies</p>
<p><br clear="left"><img style="WIDTH: 225px; HEIGHT: 276px" height="240" alt="IMG_7834_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7834_edited_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearwater, our next stop, is at the entrance to Wells Gray Provincial Park, a 5000 sq. km. wilderness park.&nbsp; We spent the next day travelling into the park and back.&nbsp; There are some beautiful waterfalls&nbsp;there. &nbsp;Helmcken Falls which is 75 ft. wide and drops&nbsp;465 feet (141&nbsp;meters)&nbsp;is said to be the fourth highest in Canada.<br clear="right"><img height="240" alt="IMG_7817_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7817_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>All through BC we have seen devastating pine tree kill-off by the Mountain Pine Beetle.&nbsp; It attacks mature lodgepole pines and thrives on warm weather.&nbsp; Several consecutive mild winters and drought-like summers have allowed the beetles to increase to epidemic levels.&nbsp; In 2007 the area of&nbsp;provincial Crown forests&nbsp;affected to some degree was 13.5 million hectares (32.1 million acres).&nbsp; The BC government has increased allowable annual cuts to&nbsp;permit salvaging or recovering the greatest value from the beetle-attacked timber.&nbsp; The timber can retain its commercial value anywhere from five to 18 years after attack.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7865_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7865_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continued south on Hwy 5, following the North Thompson River Valley, to Kamloops.&nbsp; We have moved from&nbsp;mountains to&nbsp;agriculture and large rolling hills.</p>
<p>Note the red shade on the hills &ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s the Mountain Pine Beetle damage &ndash;&nbsp;dead pine trees.&nbsp;<br clear="right"></p>
<p>One day was spent sightseeing in the city, as well as Bernie at the Art Gallery and&nbsp;Ross at the Kamloops Heritage Railway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our campground was 17 km to the east of downtown Kamloops and is part of the British Columbia Wildlife Park. The park is&nbsp;120 acres and houses, in natural habitats,&nbsp;65 species of local and endangered wildlife.&nbsp; All animals have come to the park having been abandoned or injured.&nbsp;They also have a section, which we could not visit, where work is undertaken&nbsp;to reintroduce animals to the wild.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_7896_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7896_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />We&nbsp;made a point of being&nbsp;there for the feeding of the Grizzly Bears. A brother and sister, they were orphaned about 23 years ago and have lived at the park ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;About 3 pm,&nbsp;keepers brought in a 5 gallon pail of food for each bear &ndash;salmon, vegetables, apples, lichees, plums and other fruit. They attacked the food ravenously.&nbsp; We came back to see them at about 5 pm.&nbsp; Both bears were laying down, totally satiated, and would plop a paw out to grab another piece of food, drag it&nbsp;close to their mouth and then capture it with their tongue.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>When we left the&nbsp;Kamloops area we travelled down Hwy 97 to Kelowna.&nbsp; We had travelled Hwy 97 back in the spring when we went from Dawson Creek to Watson Lake.&nbsp; This highway travels the whole length of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Kelowna is considered the gateway to the Okanagan.&nbsp; The valley was shaped by glaciers. &nbsp;Mountains, some as high as 9,800 ft., flank both sides of Okanagan Lake.&nbsp; Fertile soil and sunny weather coupled with irrigation transforms the scenic hills along the lake into an agricultural wonderland.&nbsp; Peaches, cherries, apricots, plums, apples and grapes abound and we were there right at harvest time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think we have ever eaten so many huge black cherries!</p>
<p>Our campground, in fact, was located in the middle of an orchard and we were welcome to pick peaches and plums for our own use.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1050500_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1050500_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="2" border="2" />Our stop in Kelowna was mainly to visit with friends, Jim and Jackie.&nbsp; We had been through there in 2005 and had seen most of the tourist sights then, so other than a drive up into the hills to see the orchards we basically took it easy. </p>
<p>The road south from Kelowna&nbsp;runs right along the west shore of Okanagan Lake. Everywhere there is a pocket of fertile soil, there is an orchard, a vineyard or a lawn.&nbsp; The first orchards in the region were planted in 1860&nbsp;by the Oblates at the Okanagan Mission.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="194" alt="IMG_7913_edited" hspace="2" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_7913_edited_small2.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="2" border="2" />We reached Penticton around noon on Sat. Aug 16th. and discovered a whole new recreational activity.&nbsp; Rafting &ndash; giant rubber tube rafting on the 8 km channel between Okanagan Lake and Skaha Lake.&nbsp; Hundreds of inner tubes and&nbsp;inflatable rafts lazily carrying families, teenagers and every possible age and style of person.&nbsp; There&nbsp;was even a raft rental company that sends you off&nbsp;close to Okanagan Lake and picks you (and the raft) up further down the channel. <br clear="right"></p>
<p>Our next destination&nbsp;-&nbsp;Oliver&nbsp;- is just a piece down the road.</p>
