<h2>January 15, 2008</h2>


<h3 id="a000138">The U.S. Virgin Islands</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="P1010878_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010878_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Having had loooong plane trips last spring, we decided that we wanted a short one for a mini vacation in December.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our December 9th flight to the U.S. Virgin Islands for a week,&nbsp;fit the bill.</p>
<p>St. Thomas is&nbsp;a very pretty island with houses dotted all over the rocky hills that rise out of the ocean.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1010809" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010809_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />We stayed at Bluebeard's Castle which is on a high hill overlooking both the town of Charlotte Amalie (Ah-MAHL-yah) and the Cruise ship harbour.&nbsp; We walked most places so we certainly got our exercise on the hill.&nbsp; In this picture, our room was in the top right building, second room from the end and second floor down.</p>
<p>Columbus arrived in 1493 and claimed the islands&nbsp;for Spain, but by the late 1600&rsquo;s the Danish flag was flown (under the management of the West India Company).&nbsp; The United States purchased the islands for $25 million in gold from Denmark in 1917.&nbsp; It is now an unincorporated territory of the U.S.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1010853" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010853_small.jpg" width="180" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /><img height="240" alt="P1010854" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010854_small.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />There seems to be careful attention to the preservation of historic buildings&nbsp; &ndash; although most of them now house retail establishments.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is a luxury goods shoppers&rsquo; paradise.&nbsp; We took a guess that there could be 100 jewelry stores in the main shopping area downtown.&nbsp;<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="235" alt="P1010833E_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010833E_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trip around the island took us to one of the overlooks&nbsp;where we could get a birds eye view of&nbsp;Charlotte Amalie.&nbsp; <br clear="left"><img height="139" alt="P1010911_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010911_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>One day we took the ferry to St. John &ndash; about a 45 minute ride.&nbsp; It was interesting seeing the islands from the water.&nbsp; The shoreline was much more rugged than we had expected it to be.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 385px; HEIGHT: 305px" height="240" alt="P1010880_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010880_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>In 1956 Laurence Rockefeller purchased and then transformed 2/3 of St. John into a National Park.&nbsp; We went hiking on one of the shorter trails.&nbsp; It was very hot &amp; steamy.<font size="1">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>This idyllic beach was about a mile along the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We met Bob &amp; Claire at the&nbsp;Art Gallery in the bustling little town of Cruz Bay.&nbsp; They live on a boat in the harbour.&nbsp; We talked and compared our life styles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, many similarities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday night there was a Festival in town.&nbsp; All the cruise ships had departed so the party was really for the local population.&nbsp;&nbsp; The downtown streets were closed to traffic, stores stayed open until 9, local families had set up food stands with&nbsp;all kinds of island food and numerous steel&nbsp;drum bands played in the streets.&nbsp; It was a festive time and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole atmosphere.<br clear="left"></p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1010824" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010824_small1.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of cruise ships &ndash; this was the view from our window of the cruise ship harbour.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is another harbour on the other side of town that&nbsp;can berth 2 ships.&nbsp; Two days we were there both places were full.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a day that didn&rsquo;t have at least one there.&nbsp; I would guess that there were 25 ships in, in the 7 days we were on the island.<br clear="right">There were too many people downtown&nbsp;when 5 ships&nbsp;we in and&nbsp;docked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I guess that is one point of view &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure the storekeepers there didn&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>Did we enjoy ourselves?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Will we go back?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; After having seen so many different places perhaps we are getting too hard to impress.&nbsp; And maybe, other than being a tropical island, it wasn&rsquo;t much different than the mainland.</p>
<p>We headed back to Charlotte, N.C. on December 16th to continue our winter journey.</p>

<h3 id="a000137">The rest of 2007</h3>

<p><img height="240" alt="IMG_5818_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5818_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>We came home to our trailer at the KOA just to the west of Milton, ON. late on Thursday, June 7th.</p>
<p>Mark &amp; Julie, the managers of the park, had kept an eye on it and everything was in good shape.&nbsp; Mind you we had to go shopping the next day as we had left the refrigerator virtually empty.<br clear="left"></p>
<p>We quickly got to work at the KOA, as we were to be &ldquo;work campers&rdquo; there for the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those of you who don&rsquo;t know this concept, we worked 20 hours a week between us, in exchange for our camp site.&nbsp; Ross did the grass cutting and I planted and maintained the flower beds and other landscaping.&nbsp; At the annual KOA inspection, we were pleased that the inspector acknowledged how good the park looked.&nbsp;&nbsp; We enjoyed the work, and Mark &amp; Julie were very flexible and we were able to determine our own hours so that we could plan on doing other things as well.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 175px; HEIGHT: 221px" height="240" alt="DSC_0224_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/DSC_0224_edited_small.jpg" width="190" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The family happily attended the wedding of Kim, Ross&rsquo;s niece, to Doug Wigle on July 7th.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a lovely day and we were glad to welcome Doug into our family.&nbsp; Our daughter Mandi and&nbsp;grandson Ricky were home from the Bahamas for the wedding, so it was a also a great week with them.&nbsp;<br clear="right">The end of August,&nbsp;Bernie went back to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her previous employer&nbsp;ask if she&nbsp;would come back again as interim General Manager.&nbsp; She says &ldquo;It was surprisingly easy to get back into the swing of things.&nbsp; Of course what made it much easier&nbsp;was my senior staff had not changed.&nbsp; We all picked up as if the three years I had been away had never happened.&nbsp; I retired again in mid November&nbsp;after the&nbsp;new GM was in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But&nbsp;we learned something &ndash;&nbsp;Bernie decided that&nbsp;she really liked being retired.&nbsp; Ross decided that he really liked Bernie being retired.&nbsp; Both of&nbsp;us decided that we particularly like being on the road with&nbsp;each other&nbsp;in our RV.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 276px; HEIGHT: 200px" height="240" alt="IMG_5789_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/IMG_5789_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />On October 13th, our daughter Michelle and her husband Barnaby, became the very proud parents of Timothy David, our second grandson.</p>
<p>He is wonderful! </p>
<p>We were so happy to have a month and a half of seeing him, before we were on the road again.</p>
<p>We headed south on December 2nd after visiting friends&nbsp;in Brockville, ON.&nbsp; We were fortunate as we travelled south,&nbsp;staying about 24 hours ahead of a big storm.</p>
<p>After visiting with a cousin of Ross&rsquo;s in Greenville, NC we left the trailer in Charlotte, NC for a week while we took a &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; and flew to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll write a separate journal for that trip.</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 387px; HEIGHT: 241px" height="172" alt="P1010987_edited" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010987_edited_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />In 2005 we had visited the Gulf Coast about 4 months after Katrina had devastated it.&nbsp; We decided to return there for the Christmas season (we feel it&rsquo;s important for tourists to come back) and stayed at a campground in Long Beach, Mississippi (right next to Gulfport).&nbsp; Long Beach&nbsp;was in the eye of the hurricane.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the rubble has been cleared away and there is some reconstruction happening but it was still an emotional visit.&nbsp; As we drove along the beach highway there appeared to be a wonderful park about a block deep, for miles.&nbsp; Then you realize that you are seeing driveways to nowhere, and foundations of houses hidden by shrubs.&nbsp; These blocks and blocks of emptiness&nbsp;had been&nbsp;blocks and blocks of wonderful old homes.&nbsp; Gone.</p>
<p><img height="239" alt="P1010959E" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010959E_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />One day we&nbsp;drove to New Orleans and took the city tour.&nbsp; As well as the standard visit to the French Quarter, a Cemetery, the Garden and Warehouse Districts we also had a short tour of the Lower 9th&nbsp;Ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rescuers searched each house they recorded the date searched, if any dead were found and the search team.&nbsp; After having seen the devastation, it is difficult to understand how slow and unconcerned officialdom seems to be.&nbsp; What possible &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; can there be for the lack of action.<br clear="right"></p>
<p><img height="203" alt="P1010965E" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1010965E_small.jpg" width="320" align="left" vspace="4" border="2" />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have purchased a home in the French Quarter and spend a good amount of time in New Orleans.&nbsp; He is heading a huge drive to build homes in the Lower 9th and we were able to see the &ldquo;pink tarp&rdquo; outlines where these home will be built.&nbsp; Our tour driver spoke very highly of him, indicating that the residents were impressed as he not only talked about helping, but he really &ldquo;put his money where his mouth was&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What has come back to the Gulfport area are the Casinos and with them jobs and a reason for the tourists to return.&nbsp; We had a lovely Roast Beef&nbsp; Christmas dinner at one of the big casinos.</p>
<p><img height="240" alt="P1020003" hspace="4" src="http://www.whitesrvjournal.com/images/P1020003_small.jpg" width="320" align="right" vspace="4" border="2" />From the Gulf, we headed north and&nbsp;stopped one night at Pelahatchie (just outside Jackson, MS) to visit with RV friends, Michelle and Louie.&nbsp; The next night was in Hallsville, Texas and we came across the most wonderful Christmas light display.&nbsp; No one at the attraction knew how many lights there were, but the drive was over a mile in length.&nbsp; The one way&nbsp;trail was carved out of the forest with lights strung on trees, on wire frames &ndash; actually anywhere there was a place to hang a string.&nbsp; $15.00 a car and well worth it.</p>
<p>We ended the year in Grapevine, TX which is a lovely town north of and between Dallas and Fort Worth.&nbsp; The campground was run by the City and was excellent.&nbsp; We have never found staff so friendly and willing to go out of their way to assist.</p>
<p>The Dallas/Fort Worth airport was close by and that was important as we were flying home for a couple of weeks on Jan&nbsp;2nd&nbsp;and were leaving the RV at the park.</p>
<p>We flew from DFW to Kitchener/Waterloo via Detroit.&nbsp; The KW airport is a very efficient, friendly smaller operation and we will happily try to arrange to fly in to there from now on if at all possible.</p>
<p>The day following our arrival home, Jan 3rd, we had a wonderful start to 2008.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll tell you about that in another journal.</p>
<p>Ross &amp; Bernie</p>
